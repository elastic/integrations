        "description": "A machine learning job has detected a suspicious Windows process. This\nprocess has been classified as malicious in two ways. It was predicted to be malicious\nby the ProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be an unusual child process name,\nfor the parent process, by an unsupervised ML model. Such a process may be an instance of\nsuspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to\ndetection using conventional search rules.\n",
