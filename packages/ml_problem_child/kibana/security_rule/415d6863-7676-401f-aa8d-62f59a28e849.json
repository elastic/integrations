        "description": "A machine learning job has detected a suspicious Windows process. This\nprocess has been classified as malicious in two ways. It was predicted to be malicious\nby the ProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be an unusual process,\non a host that does not commonly manifest malicious activity. Such a process may be an\ninstance of suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be\nresistant to detection using conventional search rules.\n",
