          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported
          event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the
          agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html)

        description: |-
          The request tracer logs HTTP requests and responses to the agent's
          local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request
          tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging.
