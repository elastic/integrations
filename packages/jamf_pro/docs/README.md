# JAMF Pro

The JAMF Pro integration allows you to monitor devices controlled by JAMF Pro dashboard 


Use the JAMF Pro integration to {purpose}. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference {data stream type} when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to {sample use case} you could {action}. Then you can {visualize|alert|troubleshoot} by {action}.

## Data streams

<!-- The JAMF Pro integration collects {one|two} type{s} of data streams: {logs and/or metrics}. -->

<!-- If applicable -->
<!-- **Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in {service}.
Log data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Logs](#logs-reference). -->

<!-- If applicable -->
<!-- **Metrics** give you insight into the state of {service}.
Metric data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Metrics](#metrics-reference). -->

<!-- Optional: Any additional notes on data streams -->

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
You need JAMF Pro active license and OAuth2 credentials via API App
<!--
	Optional: Other requirements including:
	* System compatibility
	* Supported versions of third-party products
	* Permissions needed
	* Anything else that could block a user from successfully using the integration
-->
