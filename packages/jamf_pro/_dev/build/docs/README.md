Jamf Pro is a comprehensive management solution designed to help organizations deploy, configure, secure, and manage Apple devices. This integration enables organizations to seamlessly monitor and protect their Mac fleet through Elastic, providing a unified view of security events across all endpoints and facilitating a more effective response to threats. This integration encompasses both event and inventory data ingestion from Jamf Pro.


## Data streams

 * __inventory__ provides Inventory data for computers. Includes: hardware, OS, etc. Saves each device as a separate log record.  
 This data stream utilizes `/v1/computers-inventory` endpoint from Jamf Pro API.

* __events__ catches events, generated by [Jamf Pro Webhooks](https://developer.jamf.com/developer-guide/docs/webhooks) This datastream requires opening a port on kibana system


## Requirements

### Inventory

* __Jamf Pro Active License and OAuth2 Credentials:__
This connector utilizes Jamf Pro API, therefore active license is a requirement

### Events

* __HTTP(S) Port opened for connection:__ On setting up the data_stream a port should be defined (9202 by default). To run the listener this port on host must be available from Jamf server.

* __Jamf Pro webhooks__ 
[Setting up webhooks ](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Webhooks.html) in Jamf Pro Dashboard.


## Setup

### Step 1: Create an Application in Jamf Pro:

To create a connection to Jamf Pro, an [application must be created](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/API_Roles_and_Clients.html) first. 
Credentials generated during this process are required for the subsequent steps.

__Permission required for Jamf Pro application__  
- _Read Computer Inventory Collection_: Access to read inventory data from the computer collection.
- _Read Computers_: Allows the application to access and read data from computers.  
__Jamf Pro API Credentials__  
**client_id** is an app specific ID, it is generated on createin step and available from app settings
**client_secret** generated after app is created, it is available only after creation. Can be regenerated if lost.

Permissions can be set up on app creation or can be updated for existing app

### Step 2: Integration Setup:
To set up the *Inventory* data stream these three fields are required:
- jamf_pro host
- cliet_id
- client_secret
*Events* data_stream is a passive listener, it should be created before webhook will be created at Jamf Pro Dashboard.  
Network settings should be defined by IT or Security person:
**Listen Address**  
**Listen Port**  
**URL**  
Auth settings will be required on Jamf Pro Webhook settings:
**Secret Header**  
**Secret Value**  

### Step 3: Create a Webhook in Jamf Pro:
Following [official documentation](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Webhooks.html):  
Settings:  
* _Webhook URL_ must be in form `https://your-elastic-agent:9202/jamf-pro-events` Note note: `9202` is a port and `/jamf-pro-events` are default values and can be changed this connector's setup. 
* _Authentication type_: `None` and `Header Authentication` are supported.  
`None` will expect _Webhook URL_ is available with no authorization required, no `secret header` and `secret value` were set on integration setup.  
`Header Authentication` will require Auth token name and value set on integration setup

| Jamf Pro Setting        | Corresponding Connector Setting | Value example                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| _Webhook URL_           | Port + URL                      | `https://your-elastic-agent:${PORT}${URL}`        |
| _Authentication type_   |                                 | Header Authentication                             |
| _Header Authentication_ | Secret Header + Secret Value    | {"Authorization":"${Header}", "Token":"${Value}"} |

* _Content Type_: `JSON`
* _Webhook Event_: Event to be selected. In case set of events is required, 1:1 webhooks should be created.
Connector provides UI to display `ComputerAdded` and `ComputerCheckIn` events.


## Logs

### Inventory
Documents from inventory are saved under `logs-*` and can be found on discover page with filtering by `event.dataset :"jamf_pro.inventory"`

By default these sections are included into Jamf API query:
 - _GENERAL_
 - _HARDWARE_
 - _OPERATING_SYSTEM_
All the sections can be enabled or disabled on connector's settings page

{{event "inventory"}}

{{fields "inventory"}}

### Events
Documents from events data_stream are saved under `logs-*` and can be found on discover page with filtering by `event.dataset :"jamf_pro.events"`

{{event "events"}}
