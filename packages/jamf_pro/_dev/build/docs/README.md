The connector provides integration with Jamf Pro, it is designed to enhance the management and security of Apple devices across an organization. 
This integration encompasses event and inventory data ingestion from Jamf Pro.


## Data streams

 * __inventory__ provides Inventory data for computers. Includes: hardware, OS, etc. Saves each device as a separate log record.  
 This data stream utilizes `/v1/computers-inventory` endpoint from Jamf Pro API.

* __events__ catches events, generated by [Jamf Pro Webhooks](https://developer.jamf.com/developer-guide/docs/webhooks) This datastream requires opening a port on kibana system



## Requirements

### Inventory

* __Jamf Pro Active License and OAuth2 Credentials:__
This connector utilizes Jamf Pro API, therefore active license is a requirement

### Events

* __HTTP(S) Port opened for connection:__ On setting up the data_stream a port should be defined (9202 by default). To run the listener this port on host must be available from Jamf server.

* __Jamf Pro webhooks__ 
[Setting up webhooks ](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Webhooks.html) in Jamf Pro Dashboard.



### Setup

* __Establishing A Connection to Jamf Pro:__ Setting up a successful connection with Jamf Pro involves creating an application and configuring the integration.  


### Step 1: Create an Application in Jamf Pro:

To create a connection to Jamf Pro, an [application must be created](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/API_Roles_and_Clients.html) first. 
Credentials generated during this process are required for the subsequent steps.

__Permission required for Jamf Pro application__  
- _Read Computer Inventory Collection_: Access to read inventory data from the computer collection.
- _Read Computers_: Allows the application to access and read data from computers.  
__Jamf Pro API Credentials__  
**client_id** is an app specific ID, it is generated on createin step and available from app settings
**client_secret** generated after app is created, it is available only after creation. Can be regenerated if lost.

Permissions can be set up on app creation or can be updated for existing app

### Step 2: Integration Setup:
To set up the  integration 3 fields are required:
- jamf_pro host
- cliet_id
- client_secret

## Events



## Logs

### Inventory
Documents from inventory are saved under `logs-*` and can be found on discover page with filtering by `event.dataset :"jamf_pro.inventory"`

By default these sections are included into Jamf API query:

 - _HARDWARE_
 - _OPERATING_SYSTEM_
All the sections can be enabled or disabled on connector's settings page

{{event "inventory"}}


{{fields "inventory"}}

### Events
Documents from events data_stream are saved under `logs-*` and can be found on discover page with filtering by `event.dataset :"jamf_pro.events"`
