# Azure Database Account Integration

The Azure Database Account data stream collects and aggregates database account related metrics from Azure Database Account type resources where it can be used for analysis, visualization, and alerting.

The Azure Database Account will periodically retrieve the Azure Monitor metrics using the Azure REST APIs as MetricList.
Additional Azure API calls will be executed to retrieve information regarding the resources targeted by the user.

## Supported namespaces and databases

The Azure Database Account integration collects metrics from the `Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts` namespace only.

The integration supports metrics for the following databases:

- Azure Cosmos DB with SQL API
- Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin
- Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra
- Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB

## Requirements

Before you start, check the [Authentication and costs](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure_metrics#authentication-and-costs) section.

## Setup

Follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure_metrics#setup) on how to set up an Azure metrics integration.

## Data stream specific configuration notes

`Period`:: (_string_) Reporting interval. Metrics will have a timegrain of 5 minutes, so the `Period` configuration option  for `database_account` should have a value of `300s` or multiple of `300s`for relevant results.

`Resource IDs`:: (_[]string_) The fully qualified ID's of the resource, including the resource name and resource type. Has the format `/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`.
  Should return a list of resources.

`Resource Groups`:: (_[]string_) This option will return all database accounts inside the resource group.

If no resource filter is specified, then all database accounts inside the entire subscription will be considered.

The primary aggregation value will be retrieved for all the metrics contained in the namespaces. The aggregation options are `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `total`, `count`.

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |
| host | A host is defined as a general computing instance. ECS host.\* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes. | group |  |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |  |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |  |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |  |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |  |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |
