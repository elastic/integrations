# Azure Storage Account Integration

The Azure Storage Account data stream collects and aggregates storage account related metrics from Azure Storage Account type resources where it can be used for analysis, visualization, and alerting.
The Azure Storage Account will periodically retrieve the Azure Monitor metrics using the Azure REST APIs as MetricList.
Additional Azure API calls will be executed to retrieve information regarding the resources targeted by the user.

## Requirements

Before you start, check the [Authentication and costs](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure_metrics#authentication-and-costs) section.

## Setup

Follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure_metrics#setup) on how to set up an Azure metrics integration.

## Data stream specific configuration notes

`Period`:: (_string_) Reporting interval. Metrics will have a timegrain of 5 minutes, so the `Period` configuration option  for `storage_account` should have a value of `300s` or multiple of `300s`for relevant results.

`Resource IDs`:: (_[]string_) The fully qualified ID's of the resource, including the resource name and resource type. Has the format `/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}`.
  Should return a list of resources.

`Resource Groups`:: (_[]string_) This option will return all storage accounts inside the resource group.

`Service Types`:: (_[]string_) The service type values allowed are `blob`, `table`, `queue`, `file`, they can be used to filter on the type of the storage account container.

`Default Timegrain`:: (*string*) Sets the default time grain to use when collecting storage account metrics. Defaults to `PT5M`.

To collect storage account metrics with a `PT1M` time grain, we recommend using one of the following configurations:

| Default Timegrain | Period | Note                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PT1M`            | `60s`  | The integration collects 1 data point every minute for each combination of metrics/dimension/aggregation.                                                                        |
| `PT1M`            | `300s` | The integration collects 5 data points every 5 minutes (one for each minute) for each combination of metrics/dimension/aggregation â€” but all data points arrive after 5 minutes. |

These two configurations trade off scalability and freshness. The first configuration (PT1M/60s) prioritizes freshness over scalability, while second configuration (PT1M/300s) prioritizes scalability over freshness.

If you want to collect metrics with `PT1M` time grain, we also suggest the following changes:

- Turn on "Advanced options > Enable Batch API": Retrieves metric values for multiple Azure resources in one API call, supporting more storage accounts.
- Set "Refresh list interval" to `30m` or `60m`: Looks for new storage accounts every 30 or 60 minutes instead of 10 minutes, helping to minimize gaps when monitoring many storage accounts.

Note: By setting the collection period to `1m`, the metricset only has 60 seconds to collect all metric values instead of 5 minutes, so it can handle fewer storage accounts. Keep in mind that the Storage Account integration collects metrics from five different namespaces (storage account, blob, file, queue, and table).


If no resource filter is specified, then all storage accounts inside the subscription will be considered.

The primary aggregation value will be retrieved for all the metrics contained in the namespaces. The aggregation options are `avg`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `total`, `count`.
