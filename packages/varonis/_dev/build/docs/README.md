# Varonis integration

The Elastic integration for [Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/) enables real-time monitoring and analysis of Varonis syslog alert data. The integration collects alert data from Varonis syslog and ships it to the Elastic Stack, where it can be analyzed and visualized.

## Data Streams

- **`logs`**: Provides alert data from Varonis syslog. This data stream includes information about alerts generated by Varonis, such as the alert type, severity, file permission changes, and more.

## Requirements

### Configure Varonis DatAlert for Syslog forwarding:

Users can configure the syslog server address in DatAlert so that alerts can be sent to elasticsearch integration. 
   - Login to the Varonis UI using admin credentials.
   - In Data Advantage, select `Tools > DatAlert > Select DatAlert`.
   - From the left menu, select `Configuration`.
   - In syslog message forwarding, do the following:
     - **Syslog server IP address**: Enter the IP address of the machine where the Elasticsearch integration agent is running.
     - **Port**: Enter the UDP port on which this integration will be configured (e.g., 9035).
   - Click `Apply`.

### Create Alert Template in Varonis DatAlert:

1. In DatAlert, select `Alert Templates`.
2. Click the Green Plus sign to add a new alert template.
3. **Template name**: Select `External system default template (CEF)`.
4. **Apply to alert methods**: Select `Syslog message`.
5. Click `OK`.

This integration expects to use `External system default template (CEF)` for alert forwarding in Varonis DatAlert tool. In case any custom template is used, all the fields in `External system default template (CEF)` should also be present in custom template along with the other additional fields. Additional fields will be part of `varonis.logs` object and such fields will be indexed only if dynamic mapping is enabled in Elasticsearch.

## Logs reference
