# Varonis integration

The Elastic integration for [Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/) enables real-time monitoring and analysis of Varonis syslog alert data. The integration collects alert data from Varonis syslog and ships it to the Elastic Stack, where it can be analyzed and visualized.

## Data Streams

- **`logs`**: Provides alert data from Varonis syslog. This data stream includes information about alerts generated by Varonis, such as the alert type, severity, file permission changes, and more.

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details and installation instructions, please refer to the [Elastic Agent Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

There are several options for installing and managing Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

Please note, there are minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent. For more information, refer to the  [Elastic Agent Minimum Requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html#elastic-agent-installation-minimum-requirements).


### Configure Varonis DatAlert for Syslog forwarding:

Users can configure the syslog server address in DatAlert so that alerts can be sent to elasticsearch integration. 
   - Login to the Varonis UI using admin credentials.
   - In Data Advantage, select `Tools > DatAlert > Select DatAlert`.
   - From the left menu, select `Configuration`.
   - In syslog message forwarding, do the following:
     - **Syslog server IP address**: Enter the IP address of the machine where the Elasticsearch integration agent is running.
     - **Port**: Enter the UDP port on which this integration will be configured (e.g., 9035).
   - Click `Apply`.

### Create Alert Template in Varonis DatAlert:

1. In DatAlert, select `Alert Templates`.
2. Click the Green Plus sign to add a new alert template.
3. **Template name**: Select `External system default template (CEF)`.
4. **Apply to alert methods**: Select `Syslog message`.
5. Click `OK`.
