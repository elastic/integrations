# Varonis integration

[Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/) is a data security platform that helps organizations protect their sensitive data from insider threats and cyberattacks. This integration collects and analyzes security alerts from Varonis, enabling real-time threat monitoring, compliance reporting, and incident response.

## Data Streams

- **`logs`**: Provides alert data from Varonis syslog. This data stream includes information about alerts generated by Varonis, such as the alert type, severity, file permission changes, and more.

## Requirements

### Configure Varonis DatAlert for Syslog forwarding:

Users can configure the syslog server address in DatAlert so that alerts can be sent to elasticsearch integration. 
   - Login to the Varonis UI using admin credentials.
   - In Data Advantage, select `Tools > DatAlert > Select DatAlert`.
   - From the left menu, select `Configuration`.
   - In syslog message forwarding, do the following:
     - **Syslog server IP address**: Enter the IP address of the machine where the Elasticsearch integration agent is running.
     - **Port**: Enter the UDP port on which this integration will be configured (e.g., 9035).
   - Click `Apply`.

### Create Alert Template in Varonis DatAlert:

1. In DatAlert, select `Alert Templates`.
2. Click the Green Plus sign to add a new alert template.
3. **Template name**: Select `External system default template (CEF)`.
4. **Apply to alert methods**: Select `Syslog message`.
5. Click `OK`.

This integration expects to use `External system default template (CEF)` for alert forwarding in Varonis DatAlert tool. In case any custom template is used, all the fields in `External system default template (CEF)` should also be present in custom template along with the other additional fields. Additional fields will be part of `varonis.logs` object and such fields will be indexed only if dynamic mapping is enabled in Elasticsearch.

## Logs reference
