              The request tracer logs requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging. See [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-httpjson.html#_request_tracer_filename) for details.
