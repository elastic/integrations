          Enable expanding ** into recursive glob patterns. With this feature enabled, the rightmost ** in each path is expanded into a fixed number of glob patterns. For example: /foo/** expands to /foo, /foo/*, /foo/*/*, and so on. If enabled it expands a single ** into a 8-level deep * pattern.
          This feature is enabled by default. Set prospector.scanner.recursive_glob to false to disable it.

        title: Enable symlinks
        description: |
          The symlinks option allows Elastic Agent to harvest symlinks in addition to regular files. When harvesting symlinks, Elastic Agent opens and reads the original file even though it reports the path of the symlink.
          ** Because this option may lead to data loss, it is disabled by default. **

        description: |
          If this option is enabled a file is resent if its size has not changed but its modification time has changed to a later time than before. It is disabled by default to avoid accidentally resending files.

        description: |

      - name: ignore_older
        type: text
        title: Ignore Older
        description: |
          If this option is enabled, Elastic Agent ignores any files that were modified before the specified timespan. You can use time strings like 2h (2 hours) and 5m (5 minutes). The default is 0, which disables the setting.
          You must set Ignore Older to be greater than On State Change Inactive.
          For more information, please see the [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-filestream.html#filebeat-input-filestream-ignore-older)

        show_user: false
      - name: ignore_inactive
        type: text
        title: Ignore Inactive
        description: |
          If this option is enabled, Elastic Agent ignores every file that has not been updated since the selected time. Possible options are since_first_start and since_last_start.

        title: Close on State Changed Inactive
        description: |
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent closes the file handle if a file has not been harvested for the specified duration. The counter for the defined period starts when the last log line was read by the harvester. It is not based on the modification time of the file. If the closed file changes again, a new harvester is started and the latest changes will be picked up after Check Interval has elapsed.
        required: false
        show_user: false

        title: Close on State Changed Renamed
        description: |
          ** Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect. **
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent closes the file handler when a file is renamed. This happens, for example, when rotating files. By default, the harvester stays open and keeps reading the file because the file handler does not depend on the file name.
        required: false
        show_user: false
      - name: close_on_state_changed_removed
        type: bool
        title: Close on State Changed Removed
        description: |
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent closes the harvester when a file is removed. Normally a file should only be removed after itâ€™s inactive for the duration specified by close.on_state_change.inactive.
        required: false
        show_user: false
      - name: close_reader_eof

        title: Close Reader EOF
        description: |
          ** Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect. **
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent closes a file as soon as the end of a file is reached. This is useful when your files are only written once and not updated from time to time. For example, this happens when you are writing every single log event to a new file. This option is disabled by default.
        required: false
        show_user: false
      - name: close_reader_after_interval
        type: text
        title: Close Reader After Interval
        description: |
          ** Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect. Another side effect is that multiline events might not be completely sent before the timeout expires. **
          This option is particularly useful in case the output is blocked, which makes Elastic Agent keep open file handlers even for files that were deleted from the disk.
          For more information see the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-filestream.html#filebeat-input-filestream-close-timeout).

        description: |
          ** Only use this option if you understand that data loss is a potential side effect. **
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent removes the state of a file after the specified period of inactivity has elapsed.

      - name: clean_removed
        type: bool
        title: Clean Removed
        description: |
          When this option is enabled, Elastic Agent cleans files from the registry if they cannot be found on disk anymore under the last known name.
          ** You must disable this option if you also disable Close Removed. **

        type: text
        title: Backoff Init
        description: |
          The backoff option defines how long Elastic Agent waits before checking a file again after EOF is reached. The default is 1s.

          ** Changing file_identity methods between runs may result in duplicated events in the output. **
          The default behaviour of Elastic Agent is to differentiate between files using their inodes and device ids.

          ** Changing file_identity methods between runs may result in duplicated events in the output. Only use this strategy if your log files are rotated to a folder outside of the scope of your input or not at all. Otherwise you end up with duplicated events. **
          To identify files based on their paths use this strategy.
