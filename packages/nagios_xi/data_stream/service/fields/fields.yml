          description: This directive is used to define an optional URL that can be used to provide more actions to be performed on the host. If you specify an URL, you will see a red "splat" icon in the CGIs (when you are viewing host information) that links to the URL you specify here. Any valid URL can be used. If you plan on using relative paths, the base path will the the same as what is used to access the CGIs (i.e. /cgi-bin/nagios/).

        - name: active_checks_enabled
          description: This directive is used to determine whether or not active checks (either regularly scheduled or on-demand) of this host are enabled. Values=> 0 = disable active host checks, 1 = enable active host checks (default).
          type: keyword
        - name: check_command
          description: This directive is used to specify the short name of the command that should be used to check if the host is up or down. Typically, this command would try and ping the host to see if it is "alive". The command must return a status of OK (0) or Nagios will assume the host is down. If you leave this argument blank, the host will not be actively checked. Thus, Nagios will likely always assume the host is up (it may show up as being in a "PENDING" state in the web interface). This is useful if you are monitoring printers or other devices that are frequently turned off. The maximum amount of time that the notification command can run is controlled by the host_check_timeout option.
