          When interpreting syslog timestamps without a time zone, use this timezone offset. Datetimes recorded in logs are by default interpreted in relation to the timezone set up on the host where the agent is operating. Use this parameter to adjust the timezone offset when importing logs from a host in a different timezone so that datetimes are appropriately interpreted. Both a canonical ID (such as "Europe/Amsterdam") and an HH:mm differential (such as "-05:00") are acceptable timezone formats.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
