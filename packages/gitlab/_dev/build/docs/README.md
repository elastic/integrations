# GitLab Integration

This integration is for ingesting logs from [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

- `api`: Collect logs for HTTP requests made to the GitLab API

- `application`: Collect logs for events in GitLab like user creation or project deletion.

- `audit`: Collect logs for changes to group or project settings and memberships.

- `auth`: Collect logs for protected paths abusive requests or requests over the Rate Limit.

- `production`: Collect logs for Rails controller requests received from GitLab.

See the GitLab [Log system docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs/) for more information.

## Compatibility

The GitLab module has been developed with and tested against the [community edition](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) version 16.8.5-ce.0. 

## Setup

Refer to the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs/) for the specific filepath(s) for your instance type. Both are provided as default in the configuration setup, but only one will be needed for use.
