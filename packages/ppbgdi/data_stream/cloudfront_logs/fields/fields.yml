        When the value of the x-edge-result-type field is Error, this field contains the specific type of error. When the object was served to the viewer from the Origin Shield cache, this field contains OriginShieldHit. In all other cases, this field contains the same value as x-edge-result-type.

        How the server classified the response just before returning the response to the viewer. See also the x-edge-result-type field.
    - name: edge_result_type
      type: keyword
      description: "How the server classified the response after the last byte left the server. In some cases, the result type can change between the time that the server is ready to send the response and the time that it finishes sending the response. \nSee also the x-edge-response-result-type field.\nFor example, in HTTP streaming, suppose the server finds a segment of the stream in the cache. In that scenario, the value of this field would ordinarily be Hit. \nHowever, if the viewer closes the connection before the server has delivered the entire segment, the final result type (and the value of this field) is Error.\nWebSocket connections will have a value of Miss for this field because the content is not cacheable and is proxied directly to the origin."
