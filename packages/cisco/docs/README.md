| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| client.domain | Server domain. | keyword |
| client.registered_domain | The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com".

Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| client.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| client.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |

For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.answers.name | The domain name to which this resource record pertains. If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated. | keyword |

| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| file.attributes | Array of file attributes. Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted, execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write. | keyword |
| file.directory | Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.extension | File extension, excluding the leading dot. Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.size | File size in bytes. Only relevant when `file.type` is "file". | long |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided: "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying." As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0 | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from. | keyword |
| log.flags | Flags for the log file. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.original | This is the original log message and contains the full log message before splitting it up in multiple parts. In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message. It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new lines removed to clean up the log message. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`. | keyword |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | text |
| network.application | A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily assigned for things like microservices, but also apply to things like skype, icq, facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where the vendor or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP owners, ports, or wire format. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS". | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   * ingress   * egress   * inbound   * outbound   * internal   * external   * unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.interface.name |  | keyword |
| network.packets | Total packets transferred in both directions. If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum. | long |

| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | keyword |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org).

Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| file.attributes | Array of file attributes. Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted, execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write. | keyword |
| file.directory | Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.extension | File extension, excluding the leading dot. Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.size | File size in bytes. Only relevant when `file.type` is "file". | long |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided: "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying." As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0 | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from. | keyword |
| log.flags | Flags for the log file. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.original | This is the original log message and contains the full log message before splitting it up in multiple parts. In contrast to the `message` field which can contain an extracted part of the log message, this field contains the original, full log message. It can have already some modifications applied like encoding or new lines removed to clean up the log message. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled so it can't be queried but the value can be retrieved from `_source`. | keyword |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | text |
| network.application | A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily assigned for things like microservices, but also apply to things like skype, icq, facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where the vendor or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP owners, ports, or wire format. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS". | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   * ingress   * egress   * inbound   * outbound   * internal   * external   * unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.interface.name |  | keyword |
| network.packets | Total packets transferred in both directions. If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum. | long |

| server.domain | Server domain. | keyword |
| server.registered_domain | The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| server.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| server.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |

| source.mac | MAC address of the source. | keyword |
| source.nat.ip | Translated ip of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | ip |
| source.nat.port | Translated port of source based NAT sessions. (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | long |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| source.registered_domain | The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| source.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| source.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | keyword |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
