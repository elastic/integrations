This is a list of selectors which are made up of regex and expand_event_list_from_field options. The regex should match the S3 object key in the SQS message, and the optional expand_event_list_from_field is the same as the global setting. If file_selectors is given, then any global expand_event_list_from_field value is ignored in favor of the ones specified in the file_selectors. Regexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed.

If you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the name in this yaml config. If you want to override any specific attribute for a specific bucket, then, you can define it here. Any attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions.
