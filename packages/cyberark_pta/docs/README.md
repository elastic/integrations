# Cyberark Privileged Threat Analytics

CyberArk's Privileged Threat Analytics (PTA) continuously monitors the use of privileged accounts that are managed in the CyberArk Privileged Access Security (PAS) platform. This integration collects analytics from PTA's syslog via CEF-formatted logs.

### Configuration

Follow the steps described under [Send PTA syslog records to SIEM](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/PTA/Outbound-Sending-%20PTA-syslog-Records-to-SIEM.htm) documentation to setup the integration:

- Sample syslog configuration for `systemparm.properties`:

```ini
[SYSLOG]
syslog_outbound=[{"siem": "Elastic", "format": "CEF", "host": "SIEM_MACHINE_ADDRESS", "port": 9301, "protocol": "TCP"}]
```

### Example event
An example event for pta looks as following:

| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |

| destination.user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| destination.user.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.user.name`. | match_only_text |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`). | keyword |
| event.reference | Reference URL linking to additional information about this event. This URL links to a static definition of this event. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field. | keyword |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.url | URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event. This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| observer.product | The product name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.version | Observer version. | keyword |
| source.domain | The domain name of the source system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.service.name |  | keyword |
| source.user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| source.user.name.text | Multi-field of `source.user.name`. | match_only_text |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
