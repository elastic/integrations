# WebSphere Application Server

This Elastic integration is used to collect the following metrics from [IBM WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-server):

   - JDBC metrics
   - Servlet metrics
   - Session Manager metrics
   - ThreadPool metrics

This integration uses Prometheus to collect above metrics.

To open Prometheus endpoint read following [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/9.0.5?topic=mosh-displaying-pmi-metrics-in-prometheus-format-metrics-app).

## JDBC

| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |

| event.kind | Event kind | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.type | Event type | constant_keyword |
| server.address | Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |

## ThreadPool

This data stream collects Thread related metrics.

An example event for `threadpool` looks as following:

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | Event category. | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.kind | Event kind | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.type | Event type | constant_keyword |
| server.address | Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.active_time_seconds | The total time (in seconds) that the threads are in active state. | double |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.name | Name of ThreadPool. | keyword |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.threads.active | The number of concurrently active threads. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.threads.cleared | The number of thread stops that cleared. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.threads.stopped.concurrent | The number of concurrently stopped threads. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.threads.stopped.declared | The number of threads that were declared stopped. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.threads.total | The number of threads in a pool. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.total.active | The number of threads that were active. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.total.created | The total number of threads that were created. | long |
| websphere_application_server.threadpool.total.destroyed | The total number of threads that were destroyed. | long |
