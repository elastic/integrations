        title: Containers
        description: >
          This attribute contains the details about a specific container like, name, number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval etc. The attribute 'name' is specific to a container as it describes the container name, while the fields number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval can exist both at the container level and at the global level.  If you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the container name in this yaml config. If you want to override any specific attribute for a container, then, you can define it here. Any attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions.  Please see the relevant [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-azure-blob-storage.html#attrib-containers) for further information.

          If the container will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldn’t process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded.  This is a list of selectors which is made up of regex patters. The regex should match the container filepath.  Regexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed.

          If the file-set using this input expects to receive multiple messages bundled under a specific field or an array of objects then the config option for 'expand_event_list_from_field' can be specified. This setting will be able to split the messages under the group value into separate events. This can be specified at the global level or at the container level.
