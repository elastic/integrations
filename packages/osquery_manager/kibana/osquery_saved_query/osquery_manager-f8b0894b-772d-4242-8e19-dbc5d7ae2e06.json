    "description": "Parse systemd services on Linux systems. Provides visibility into systemd service units including: (1) Service identification (unit name, description), (2) Load state (whether unit definition was properly loaded), (3) Activation state (high-level active/inactive status), (4) Sub-state details (low-level unit activation state), (5) Service enablement status (enabled, disabled, masked), (6) Unit file path (source of unit configuration). Detection focuses on: services in unexpected states (loaded but inactive), services with unusual configurations, masked or disabled critical services. Use Cases: System service inventory, service state monitoring, persistence mechanism detection (systemd service-based persistence), unauthorized service installation detection, service misconfiguration identification, compliance auditing for service configurations.",
