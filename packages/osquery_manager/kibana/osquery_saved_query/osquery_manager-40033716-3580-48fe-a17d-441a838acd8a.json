Includes bound subscriptions (active persistence) AND orphaned components (filters/consumers without bindings) which may indicate residual or partially removed malware. WMI eventing allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands or scripts when specific system events occur. Enriched with file hashes, code signatures, and file timestamps for referenced executables and scripts.",
