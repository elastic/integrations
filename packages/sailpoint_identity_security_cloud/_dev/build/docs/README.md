# Sailpoint identity security cloud integration

The Elastic integration for [Sailpoint identity security cloud](https://www.sailpoint.com/products/identity-security-cloud) enables real-time monitoring and analysis of identity security events within the SailPoint platform. This integration collects, processes, and visualizes audit logs, access activities, and identity lifecycle events to enhance security posture, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Data Streams

- **`events`**: Provides audit data that includes actions such as `USER_MANAGEMENT`, `PASSWORD_ACTIVITY`, `PROVISIONING`, `ACCESS_ITEM`, `SOURCE_MANAGEMENT`, `CERTIFICATION`, `AUTH`, `SYSTEM_CONFIG`, `ACCESS_REQUEST`, `SSO`, `WORKFLOW`, `SEGMENT` and more.
- [Audit Events](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/IdentityNow-Wiki/Audit-Events-in-Cloud-Audit/ta-p/218727) are records that a user took action in an IdentityNow tenant, or other service like IdentityAI. Audit Events are structurally and conceptually very similar to IdentityIQ's Audit Events, but have evolved in several ways.
- This data stream leverages the Sailpoint identity security cloud API's `/v2024/search/events` endpoint to retrieve event logs.

## Requirements

### Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Log in to the application with an administrator account and generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. Personal access tokens are associated with a user in **Sailpoint identity security cloud** and inherit the user's permission level (e.g., Admin, Helpdesk, etc.) to determine access.

To create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** using an **admin account**, follow the instructions provided in the official documentation:  
[Generate a Personal Access Token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/authentication#generate-a-personal-access-token).
