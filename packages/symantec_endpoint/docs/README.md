# Symantec Endpoint Protection Integration

This integration is for [Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP)](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=tech171741) logs. It can be used
to receive logs sent by SEP over syslog or read logs exported to a text file.

The log message is expected to be in CSV format. Syslog RFC3164 and RCF5424
headers are allowed and will be parsed if present. The data is mapped to
ECS fields where applicable and the remaining fields are written under
`symantec_endpoint.log.*`.

If a specific SEP log type is detected then `event.provider` is set (e.g.
`Agent Traffic Log`).

## Syslog setup steps

1. Enable this integration with the UDP input.
2. If the Symantec management server and Elastic Agent are running on different 
hosts then configure the integration to listen on 0.0.0.0 so that it will accept
UDP packets on all interfaces. This makes the listening port reachable by the
Symantec server.
3. Configure the Symantec management server to send syslog to the Elastic Agent
that is running this integration. See [Exporting data to a Syslog server](
https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/endpoint-security-and-management/endpoint-protection/all/Monitoring-Reporting-and-Enforcing-Compliance/viewing-logs-v7522439-d37e464/exporting-data-to-a-syslog-server-v8442743-d15e1107.html)
in the SEP guide. Use the IP address or hostname of the Elastic Agent as the
syslog server address. And use the listen port as the destination port (default
is 9008).

## Log file setup steps

1. Configure the Symantec management server to export log data to a text file.
See [Exporting log data to a text file](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/endpoint-security-and-management/endpoint-protection/all/Monitoring-Reporting-and-Enforcing-Compliance/viewing-logs-v7522439-d37e464/exporting-log-data-to-a-text-file-v8440135-d15e1197.html).
2. Enable this integration with the log file input. Configure the input to
read from the location where the log files are being written. The default is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager\data\dump\*.log`.

Logs exported to text file always begin with the event time and severity
columns (e.g. `2020-01-16 08:00:31,Critical,...`).

## Log samples

Below are samples of some different SEP log types. These examples have had their
syslog header removed, but when sent over syslog these lines typically
begin with an RFC3164 header like
`<51>Oct 3 10:38:14 symantec.endpointprotection.test SymantecServer: `
