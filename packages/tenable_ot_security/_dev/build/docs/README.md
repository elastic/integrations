# Tenable OT Security 

The Elastic integration for [Tenable OT Security](https://www.tenable.com/products/ot-security) enables real-time monitoring and analysis of operational technology security events within industrial environments. This integration collects data from Tenable OT Security platform to provide visibility into cyber threats, malicious insider activities, and human errors.


## Data Streams

**[Assets](https://docs.tenable.com/OT-security/4_1/Content/Inventory/ViewAssetDetails.htm)**: Assets represent the inventory of devices and systems monitored by Tenable OT Security, including their properties, classifications, and security posture.

**[Events](https://docs.tenable.com/OT-security/4_1/Content/Events/Events.htm)**: Events are notifications generated by Tenable OT Security to alert on potentially harmful activities in the industrial network, categorized by severity and type.

**[System_Logs](https://docs.tenable.com/tenable-core/OT-security/Content/TenableCore/SystemLog.htm)**: System logs provides detailed records of events, activities, and changes occurring within the OT environment. These logs are critical for monitoring, auditing, and investigating security incidents. They capture data from various OT assets, such as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces), and other industrial devices.
