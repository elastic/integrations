# Tenable OT Security 

The Elastic integration for [Tenable OT Security](https://www.tenable.com/products/ot-security) enables real-time monitoring and analysis of operational technology security events within industrial environments. This integration collects data from Tenable OT Security platform to provide visibility into cyber threats, malicious insider activities, and human errors.

## Data Streams

**[Assets](https://docs.tenable.com/OT-security/4_1/Content/Inventory/ViewAssetDetails.htm)**: Assets represent the inventory of devices and systems monitored by Tenable OT Security, including their properties, classifications, and security posture.
- This data stream leverages the Tenable OT Security graphql API's `/graphql` endpoint to retrieve assets logs.

- **[Events](https://docs.tenable.com/OT-security/4_1/Content/Events/Events.htm)**:  Events are notifications generated by Tenable OT Security to alert on potentially harmful activities in the industrial network, categorized by severity and type.

- This data stream leverages the Tenable OT Security graphql API's `/graphql` endpoint to retrieve event logs.

- **[System_Logs](https://docs.tenable.com/tenable-core/OT-security/Content/TenableCore/SystemLog.htm)**: System logs provides detailed records of events, activities, and changes occurring within the OT environment. These logs are critical for monitoring, auditing, and investigating security incidents. They capture data from various OT assets, such as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces), and other industrial devices.

- This data stream leverages the Tenable OT Security graphql API's `/graphql` endpoint to retrieve system logs.

## Requirements

### Access, setup and data
Login into Tenable's cloud platform to generate a unique set of API keys for each user account. These keys allow applications to authenticate to Tenable's API without creating a session.

Once you have created the Api key and you know its access key and secret key, you have everything you need to generate an access_token. You will need this access_token to authenticate your requests to the APIs.

For more details on generating an access token, please refer to the API documentation [here](https://developer.tenable.com/docs/ot-generate-an-api-key)

### Steps to Generate an API Key
To authenticate to the Tenable OT Security APIs, generate an access token and include it in your requests as described below.
To create an API key in [Tenable OT Security](https://developer.tenable.com/docs/ot-generate-an-api-key), follow these steps::

## API Authorization

To authorize your application to use Tenable's API, you must include the `X-ApiKeys` header element in your HTTP request messages.
