Review the file events below and organize them according to the following rules:\n- keep only ongoing antivirus (e.g. Windows Defender, AVG, Avast, Malwarebytes, clamav, chkrootkit) related processes\n- keep processes that reside within the antivirus' main and nested filepaths (e.g., C:ProgramDataMicrosoftWindows Defender..., C:Program FilesAVG..., C:Program FilesAvast Software..., /Applications/AVGAntivirus.app/...)\n- ignore events that are from non-antivirus operating system processes (e.g. C:WindowsSystem32...)\n- ignore events that are single run processes (e.g. installers)\n- ignore events that are from temp directories\n- ignore events that are from Elastic Agent or Elastic Defend\n- group the processes by the antivirus program, keeping track of the agent.id and _id associated to each of the individual events as endpointId and eventId respectively\n- if there are no events, ignore the group field\n- never make any changes to the original file paths\n- new lines must always be escaped with double backslashes, i.e. \\\\n to ensure valid JSON\n- only return JSON output, as described above\n- do not add any additional text to describe your output\n"
