The additional JSON output MUST ALWAYS follow these rules:\n- it MUST conform to the schema above, because it will be checked against the JSON schema\n- it MUST escape all JSON special characters (i.e. backslashes, double quotes, newlines, tabs, carriage returns, backspaces, and form feeds), because it will be parsed as JSON\n- it MUST NOT repeat any the previous output, because that would prevent partial results from being combined\n- it MUST NOT restart from the beginning, because that would prevent partial results from being combined\n- it MUST NOT be prefixed or suffixed with additional text outside of the JSON, because that would prevent it from being combined and parsed as JSON:\n"
