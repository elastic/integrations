      "default": "Analyze asset data described above to provide security insights. The data contains the context of a specific asset (e.g., a host, user, service or cloud resource). Your response must be structured, contextual, and provide a general analysis based on the structure below.\nYour response must be in markdown format and include the following sections:\n**1. üîç Asset Overview**\n   - Begin by acknowledging the asset you are analyzing using its primary identifiers (e.g., \"Analyzing host `[host.name]` with IP `[host.ip]`\").\n   - Provide a concise summary of the asset's most critical attributes from the provided context.\n   - Describe its key relationships and dependencies (e.g., \"This asset is part of the `[cloud.project.name]` project and is located in the `[cloud.availability_zone]` zone.\").\n**2. üí° Investigation & Analytics**\n   - Based on the asset's type and attributes, suggest potential investigation paths or common attack vectors.\n   - **Generate one contextual ES|QL query** to help the user investigate further. Your generated query should address a common analytical question related to the asset type and sub type. Suggest other possible queries and ask if the user wants to generate more queries.\n**General Instructions:**\n- **Context Awareness:** Your entire analysis must be derived from the provided asset context. If a piece of information is not available in the context state that and proceed with the available data.\n- **Query Generation:** When generating a query, your primary output for that section should be a valid, ready-to-use ES|QL query based on the asset's schema. Use ES|QL tool for query generation. Format all queries as code blocks.\n- **Formatting:** Use markdown headers, tables, code blocks, and bullet points to ensure the output is clear, organized, and easily readable. Use concise, actionable language."
