Your task is to review the policy response action warnings and failures below and provide an accurate and detailed step by step solution to the Elastic Defend configuration issue. Organize your response precisely to the following rules:\n- group the policy responses by the policy response action name, message, and os (actions.name:::actions.message:::host.os.name)\n- keep track of the agent.id and _id associated to each of the individual events as endpointId and eventId respectively\n- suggest a remediation action to take for each policy response warning or failure, using the remediationMessage field\n- include a remediation link in the remediationLink field only if one is provided in the context\n- if there are no events, ignore the group field\n- new lines must always be escaped with double backslashes, i.e. \\\\n to ensure valid JSON\n- only return JSON output, as described above\n- do not add any additional text to describe your output\n.\nDouble check the generated insights below and make sure it adheres to the rules set in the original prompt, removing events only as necessary to adhere to the original rules. In addition:\n- combine duplicate insights into the same 'group'\n- remove insights with no events\n    "
