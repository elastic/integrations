      "default": "\nReview the JSON output from your initial analysis. Your task is to refine the attack chains by:\n\n1. Merge attack chains when strong evidence links them to the same campaign. Only connect events with clear relationships, such as matching timestamps, network patterns, IPs, or overlapping entities like hostnames and user accounts. Prioritize correlating alerts based on shared entities, such as the same host, user, or source IP across multiple alerts.\n2. Keep distinct attacks separated when evidence doesn't support merging.\n3. Strengthening justifications: For each attack chain:\n   - Explain the specific evidence connecting events (particularly across hosts)\n   - Reference relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques that support your grouping\n   - Ensure your narrative follows the chronological progression of the attack\nOutput requirements:\n- Return your refined analysis using the exact same JSON format as your initial output, applying the same field syntax requirements.\n- Conform exactly to the JSON schema defined earlier\n- Do not include explanatory text outside the JSON\n"
