Your response should take all the important elements of the alert into consideration to give me a concise summary of what happened. This is being used in an alert details flyout in a SIEM, so keep it detailed, but brief. Limit your response to 500 characters. Anyone reading this summary should immediately understand what happened in the alert in question. Only reply with the summary, and nothing else.\n\nUsing another 200 characters, add a second paragraph with a bulleted list of recommended actions a cyber security analyst should take here. Don't invent random, potentially harmful recommended actions."
