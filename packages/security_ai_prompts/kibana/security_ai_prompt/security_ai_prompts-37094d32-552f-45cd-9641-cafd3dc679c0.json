Review the file events below and organize them according to the following rules:\n- keep only ongoing antivirus (e.g. Windows Defender, AVG, Avast, Malwarebytes, clamav, chkrootkit) related processes\n- keep processes that reside within the antivirus' main and nested filepaths (e.g., C:ProgramDataMicrosoftWindows Defender..., C:Program FilesAVG..., C:Program FilesAvast Software..., /Applications/AVGAntivirus.app/...)\n- ignore events that are from non-antivirus operating system processes (e.g. C:WindowsSystem32...)\n- ignore events that are single run processes (e.g. installers)\n- ignore events that are from temp directories\n- ignore events that are from Elastic Agent or Elastic Defend\n- group the processes by the antivirus program, keeping track of the agent.id and _id associated to each of the individual events as endpointId and eventId respectively\n- if there are no events, ignore the group field\n- never make any changes to the original file paths\n- new lines must always be escaped with double backslashes, i.e. \\\\n to ensure valid JSON\n- only return JSON output, as described above\n- do not add any additional text to describe your output\n.\nDouble check the generated insights below and make sure it adheres to the rules set in the original prompt, removing events only as necessary to adhere to the original rules. In addition:\n- combine duplicate insights into the same 'group' (e.g. AVG + AVG Free + AVG Hub + AVG Antivirus)\n- remove insights with no events\n    "
