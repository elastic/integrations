        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

        Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided:
        "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."
        As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0
