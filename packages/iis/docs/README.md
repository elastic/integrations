IIS (Internet Information Services) is a secure, reliable, and scalable Web server that provides an easy to manage platform for developing and hosting Web applications and services.

The `iis` package will periodically retrieve IIS related metrics using performance counters such as:

 - System/Process counters like the the overall server and CPU usage for the IIS Worker Process and memory (currently used and available memory for the IIS Worker Process).
 - IIS performance counters like Web Service: Bytes Received/Sec, Web Service: Bytes Sent/Sec, etc, which are helpful to track to identify potential spikes in traffic.
 - Web Service Cache counters in order to monitor user mode cache and output cache.

and also parses access and error logs generated by IIS.

The `iis` integration datasets are:

### webserver
The `webserver` dataset allows users to retrieve aggregated metrics for the entire webserver.

An example event for `webserver` looks as following:

## Logs

### Compatibility

The IIS module has been tested with logs from version 7.5 and version 10.

### access
This dataset will collect and parse access IIS logs.

An example event for `access` looks as following:

| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |

| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |

| http.request.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the request body. | long |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided: "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying."

| message | Message. | text |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen in the event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names seen in the event. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
