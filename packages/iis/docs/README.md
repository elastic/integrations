IIS (Internet Information Services) is a secure, reliable, and scalable Web server that provides an easy to manage platform for developing and hosting Web applications and services.

The `iis` package will periodically retrieve IIS related metrics using performance counters such as:

 - System/Process counters like the the overall server and CPU usage for the IIS Worker Process and memory (currently used and available memory for the IIS Worker Process).
 - IIS performance counters like Web Service: Bytes Received/Sec, Web Service: Bytes Sent/Sec, etc, which are helpful to track to identify potential spikes in traffic.
 - Web Service Cache counters in order to monitor user mode cache and output cache.

and also parses access and error logs generated by IIS.

The `iis` integration datasets are:

## Metrics

## Logs

### Compatibility

The IIS module has been tested with logs from version 7.5 and version 10.

### access
This dataset will collect and parse access IIS logs.

The fields reported are:

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| dataset.name | Dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| dataset.namespace | Dataset namespace. | constant_keyword |
| dataset.type | Dataset type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| http.request.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the request body. | long |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided: "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying." As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0 | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| http.response.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the response body. | long |
| http.response.status_code | HTTP response status code. | long |
| http.version | HTTP version. | keyword |
| iis.access.cookie | The content of the cookie sent or received, if any. | keyword |
| iis.access.server_name | The name of the server on which the log file entry was generated. | keyword |
| iis.access.site_name | The site name and instance number. | keyword |
| iis.access.sub_status | The HTTP substatus code. | long |
| iis.access.win32_status | The Windows status code. | long |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| source.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| source.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | keyword |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |


### error
This dataset will collect and parse error IIS logs.
