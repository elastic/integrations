# IIS (Internet Information Services) integration

The IIS (Internet Information Services) integration allows you to monitor your IIS Web servers.
IIS is a secure, reliable, and scalable Web server that provides an easy to manage platform for developing and hosting Web applications and services.

Use the IIS integration to collect data. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics and logs when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could:

* Use IIS System/Process counters like the overall server and CPU usage for the IIS Worker Process and memory to understand how much memory is currently being used and how much is available.
* Use IIS performance counters like _Web Service: Bytes Received/Sec_ and _Web Service: Bytes Sent/Sec_ to track to identify potential spikes in traffic.
* Use IIS Web Service Cache counters to monitor user mode cache and output cache.

## Data streams

The IIS integration collects two types of data streams: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening on your IIS Web servers.
Log data streams collected by the IIS integration include `access` and `error`.
Find more details in [Logs](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of your IIS Web servers.
Metric data streams collected by the IIS integration include `webserver`, `website`, and `application_pool`.
Find more details in [Metrics](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your hardware.

## Setup

<!-- Any prerequisite instructions -->

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
{{ url "getting-started-observability" "Getting started" }} guide.

<!-- Additional set up instructions -->
For more information on configuring IIS logging, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis).

## Logs

### Compatibility

The IIS module has been tested with logs from version 7.5, 8 and version 10.

### access

This data stream will collect and parse access IIS logs. The supported log format is W3C. The W3C log format is customizable with different fields.

The IIS ships logs with few fields by default and if the user is interested in customizing the selection, the IIS Manager provides ability to add new fields for logging.

IIS integration offers certain field combinations shipped automatically into Elasticsearch using ingest pipelines. The supported formats are listed below,

#### Default Logging:

    - Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken

#### Custom Logging:

    - Fields: date time s-sitename cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(cookie) cs(Referer) cs-host sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
