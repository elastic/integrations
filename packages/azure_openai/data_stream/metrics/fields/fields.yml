      description: Number of Training Hours Processed on an OpenAI FineTuned Model.
    - name: time_to_response.avg
      type: float
      metric_type: gauge
      description: Recommended latency (responsiveness) measure for streaming requests. Applies to PTU and PTU-managed deployments. Calculated as time taken for the first response to appear after a user sends a prompt, as measured by the API gateway. This number increases as the prompt size increases and/or cache hit size reduces.
    - name: context_tokens_cache_match_rate.avg
      type: float
      metric_type: gauge
      description: Percentage of the prompt tokens hit the cache (Avaiable for PTU-managed).
    - name: provisioned_managed_utilization_v2.avg
      type: float
      metric_type: gauge
      unit: percent
      description: Utilization % for a provisoned-managed deployment, calculated as (PTUs consumed / PTUs deployed) x 100. When utilization is greater than or equal to 100%, calls are throttled and error code 429 returned.
