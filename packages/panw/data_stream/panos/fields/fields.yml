For example, to learn the URL of a file that the firewall forwarded to WildFire for analysis, locate the session ID and the url_idx from the WildFire Submissions log and search for the same session ID and url_idx in your URL filtering logs. The log entry that matches the session ID and url_idx will contain the URL of the file that was forwarded to WildFire.
