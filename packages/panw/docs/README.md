# Palo Alto Network Integration

This integration is for Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewall monitoring logs received over Syslog or read from a file. It currently supports messages of [GlobalProtect](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/globalprotect-log-fields.html), [HIP Match](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/hip-match-log-fields.html), [Threat](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html), [Traffic](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/traffic-log-fields.html), [User-ID](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/user-id-log-fields.html), [Authentication](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/authentication-log-fields), [Config](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/config-log-fields), [Correlated Events](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/correlated-events-log-fields), [Decryption](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/decryption-log-fields), [GTP](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/gtp-log-fields), [IP-Tag](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/ip-tag-log-fields), [SCTP](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/sctp-log-fields), [System](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/system-log-fields) and [Tunnel Inspection](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/tunnel-inspection-log-fields) types.

## Compatibility

- This integration supports PAN-OS versions 8.1 to 11.0, but limited compatibility is expected for earlier versions. 

- This integration supports logs of GlobalProtect for PAN-OS version 9.1.3 or above.

- This integration supports logs of User-ID for PAN-OS version 8.1 or above.

- This integration supports logs of Tunnel Inspection for PAN-OS version 9.1 or above.

- This integration supports logs of configuration changes with and without details about the changed configuration(`before-change-detail` and `after-change-detail`). Please read [Note](#note) for more details.

- This module has been tested with logs generated by devices running PAN-OS versions 7.1 to 11.0. 

## Configurations

To configure syslog monitoring, please follow the steps mentioned in the [_Configure Syslog Monitoring_](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/configure-syslog-monitoring).

## Note
- If events are getting truncated, then increase `max_message_size` option for TCP and UDP input type.
  - It can be found under Advanced Options and can be configured as per requirements. The default value of `max_message_size` is set to 50KiB.

- If the TCP input is used, it is recommended that PAN-OS is configured to send syslog messages using the IETF (RFC 5424) format. In addition, RFC 6587 framing (Octet Counting) will be enabled by default on the TCP input.
- If you want to see the configuration before and after the change(fields `before-change-detail` and `after-change-detail`) in the [config-log](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/config-log-fields), please use the following [custom log format in the syslog server profile](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/custom-logevent-format):
  ``1,$receive_time,$serial,$type,$subtype,2561,$time_generated,$host,$vsys,$cmd,$admin,$client,$result,$path,$before-change-detail,$after-change-detail,$seqno,$actionflags,$dg_hier_level_1,$dg_hier_level_2,$dg_hier_level_3,$dg_hier_level_4,$vsys_name,$device_name,$dg_id,$comment,0,$high_res_timestamp``

## Logs

### PAN-OS

This is the `panos` data stream.

An example event for `panos` looks as following:

| destination.user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| destination.user.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.user.name`. | match_only_text |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | `event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If `event.start` and `event.end` are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | `event.end` contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`). | keyword |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.start | `event.start` contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.path.text | Multi-field of `file.path`. | match_only_text |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| host.os.full.text | Multi-field of `host.os.full`. | match_only_text |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
