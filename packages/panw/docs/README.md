# Palo Alto Network Integration

This integration is for Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewall monitoring logs received over Syslog or read from a file. It currently supports messages of [GlobalProtect](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/globalprotect-log-fields.html), [HIP Match](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/hip-match-log-fields.html), [Threat](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/threat-log-fields.html), [Traffic](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/traffic-log-fields.html) and [User-ID](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/user-id-log-fields.html) types.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested with logs generated by devices running PAN-OS versions 7.1 to 9.0 but limited compatibility is expected for earlier versions.

The ingest-geoip Elasticsearch plugin is required to run this module.

| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| destination.user.email | User email address. | keyword |
| destination.user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |

| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| hostname | Name of host parsed from syslog message. | keyword |
| http.request.referer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| labels | Custom key/value pairs. Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword. Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels. | object |

| labels.url_filter_denied |  | boolean |
| labels.x_forwarded_for |  | boolean |
| log.file.path | Path to the log file. | keyword |
| log.flags | Flags for the log file. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.application | When a specific application or service is identified from network connection details (source/dest IPs, ports, certificates, or wire format), this field captures the application's or service's name. For example, the original event identifies the network connection being from a specific web service in a `https` network connection, like `facebook` or `twitter`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.packets | Total packets transferred in both directions. If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum. | long |
