# Palo Alto Network Integration

This integration is for Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewall monitoring logs received over Syslog or read from a file. It currently supports messages of Traffic and Threat types.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested with logs generated by devices running PAN-OS versions 7.1 to 9.0 but limited compatibility is expected for earlier versions.

The ingest-geoip Elasticsearch plugin is required to run this module.
