Here's some (brief) written instructions on testing the integration.

- Check out and install elastic-package, https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package, the Elastic CLI tool for developing integrations

- Once installed, navigate to the ti_strider directory and run `elastic-package stack up -d` to spin up a local elastic stack with all the bells and whistles already preconfigured. 

- Once the stack is up and running, run `elastic-package build` to build the package. 

- Then run `elastic-package install` to add the integration to the package registry of your local elastic stack.

- Navigate to https://localhost:5601/app/integrations/browse and enter login credentials: 
	username: elastic
	password: changeme

- Search for "Strider Shield", select it and then select "Add Strider Shield". 

- Enter your Shield API ID and Secret. 

- In the "Where to add this integration?" section, select `Existing hosts`, and in the dropdown menu select `Elastic-Agent (elastic-package)`. 
 
- Press `Save and Continue`, and the integration should start up.

- To tear everything down, run `elastic-package stack down`.

We cannot schedule syncs to run at specific times, we can only sync on an interval basis (e.g. every 30 minutes, every 24 hours). We are currently using 24 hours.

Source indices will be found in indices named `logs-ti_strider.indicator-*`, and will contain duplicate data and archived IOCs.
The destination index, which contains the deduped data, and no archived IOCs, will be found in the index `logs-ti_strider_latest.indicator-1`.

It takes a little bit of time, maybe up to 5 minutes for the destination index to populate after each sync.

Data in source indices will be deleted after a week.
