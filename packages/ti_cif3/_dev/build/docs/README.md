# Collective Intelligence Framework v3 Integration

This integration connects with the [REST API from the running CIFv3 instance](https://github.com/csirtgadgets/bearded-avenger-deploymentkit/wiki/REST-API) to retrieve indicators.

## Agentless Enabled Integration

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).
Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Expiration of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Indicators are expired after a certain duration. An [Elastic Transform](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transforms.html) is created for a source index to allow only active indicators to be available to the end users. The transform creates a destination index named `logs-ti_cif3_latest.dest_feed*` which only contains active and unexpired indicators. Destination indices are aliased to `logs-ti_cif3_latest.feed`. The indicator match rules and dashboards are updated to show only active indicators.

| Indicator Type    | Indicator Expiration Duration                  |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| `ipv4-addr`       | `45d`                                           |
| `ipv6-addr`       | `45d`                                           |
| `domain-name`     | `90d`                                           |
| `url`             | `365d`                                          |
| `file`            | `365d`                                          |
| All Other Types   | Derived from `IOC Expiration Duration` setting  |

### Data retention

Threat indicators are re-collected across polling intervals, and the latest transform keeps the active, deduplicated view in its destination index. The source data streams therefore hold repeated copies of the same indicators.

The package bounds the growth of these source data streams with a retention that depends on the deployment type:

| Data stream | Self-managed and Elastic Cloud Hosted (ILM policy) | Serverless (data stream lifecycle) |
|---|---|---|
| `logs-ti_cif3.feed-*` | `logs-ti_cif3.feed-default_policy`: roll over after 2d, delete 3d after rollover | delete 5d after ingestion |

On self-managed and Elastic Cloud Hosted deployments the ILM policy applies. The data stream lifecycle shipped with the package is not used there. ILM counts the delete age from the rollover of a backing index, so a document can remain for up to the rollover age plus the delete age. On Serverless, ILM is not available and the data stream lifecycle applies instead: documents are deleted the stated time after they are ingested. Where the package installs a transform, the transform's destination indices are not affected by either.

To keep data for a different period:

- Self-managed and Elastic Cloud Hosted: edit the ILM policy in Kibana under **Stack Management → Index Lifecycle Policies**, or with `PUT _ilm/policy/<policy name>`. A package upgrade reinstalls the package's ILM policies, so check your change after upgrading.
- Serverless: set the retention on the data stream, for example `PUT _data_stream/logs-ti_cif3.feed-default/_lifecycle` with the body `{"data_retention": "90d"}`. Replace `default` with your namespace.

## Data Streams

### Feed

The CIFv3 integration collects threat indicators based on user-defined configuration including a polling interval, how far back in time it should look, and other filters like indicator type and tags.

CIFv3 `confidence` field values (0..10) are converted to ECS confidence (None, Low, Medium, High) in the following way:

| CIFv3 Confidence | ECS Conversion |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Beyond Range     | None           |
| 0 - \<3          | Low            |
| 3 - \<7          | Medium         |
| 7 - 10           | High           |

{{fields "feed"}}

{{event "feed"}}
