        title: Buckets
        description: >
          This attribute contains the details about a specific bucket like, name, number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval and bucket_timeout. The attribute 'name' is specific to a bucket as it describes the bucket name, while the fields number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval and bucket_timeout can exist both at the bucket level and at the global level. If you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the name in this yaml config. If you want to override any specific attribute for a specific bucket, then, you can define it here. Any attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions. Please see the relevant [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.5/filebeat-input-gcs.html#attrib-buckets) for further information.

          If the GCS bucket will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldn’t process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded. This is a list of selectors which is made up of regex patters. The regex should match the GCS bucket filepath. Regexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed.
