The attribute 'name' is specific to a bucket as it describes the bucket name, while the fields number_of_workers, poll, poll_interval and bucket_timeout can exist both at the bucket level and at the global level. If you have already defined the attributes globally, then you can only specify the name in this yaml config. If you want to override any specific attribute for a specific bucket, then, you can define it here. Any attribute defined in the yaml will override the global definitions. Please see the relevant [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.5/filebeat-input-gcs.html#attrib-buckets) for further information.\n"
