# Snort Integration

This integration is for [Snort](https://www.snort.org/). 

## Compatibility

This module has been developed against Snort v2.9, but is expected to work
with other versions of Snort. This package is designed to read from the PFsense CSV output
and the Alert Fast output either via reading a local logfile or receiving messages via syslog

## Log
