# Snort Integration

This integration is for [Snort](https://www.snort.org/). 

## Compatibility

This module has been developed against Snort v2.9 and v3, but is expected to work
with other versions of Snort. This package is designed to read from the PFsense CSV output,
the Alert Fast output either via reading a local logfile or receiving messages via syslog and the Snort 3 JSON log file.
