          Program is the CEL program that is executed each polling period to get and transform the API data. More information can be found in the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-cel.html#_execution). For APIs that don't follow the TAXII protocol, generate this program in convenience to match API requirements. Pay special attention to headers, parameters, pagination, body formatting and error handling specific to the target API.
