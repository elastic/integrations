# Cloudflare Integration

Cloudflare integration uses [Cloudflare's API](https://api.cloudflare.com/) to retrieve [audit logs](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002833612-Understanding-Cloudflare-Audit-Logs) and [traffic logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/understanding-the-basics/) from Cloudflare, for a particular zone, and ingest them into Elasticsearch. This allows you to search, observe and visualize the Cloudflare log events through Elasticsearch.

Users of [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/what-is-cloudflare/) use Cloudflare services to increase the security and performance of their web sites and services. 

## Configuration

### Enabling the integration in Elastic

1. In Kibana go to **Management > Integrations**
2. In the "Search for integrations" search bar type **Cloudflare**.
3. Click on "Cloudflare" integration from the search results.
4. Click on **Add Cloudflare** button to add Cloudflare integration.

### Configure Cloudflare audit logs data stream

Enter values "Auth Email", "Auth Key" and "Account ID".

1. **Auth Email** is the email address associated with your account. 
2. [**Auth Key**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/keys/) is the API key generated on the "My Account" page.
3. **Account ID** can be found on the Cloudflare dashboard. Follow the navigation documentation from [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

NOTE: See for `X-AUTH-EMAIL` and `X-AUTH-KEY` [here](https://api.cloudflare.com/#getting-started-requests) for more information on Auth Email and Auth Key.

### Configure Cloudflare logs

These logs contain data related to the connecting client, the request path through the Cloudflare network, and the response from the origin web server. For more information see [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/).

The integration can retrieve Cloudflare logs using -

1. Auth Email and Auth Key
2. API Token

More information is available [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/requesting-logs/#required-authentication-headers)

#### Configure using Auth Email and Auth Key

#### Configure using API Token

Enter values "API Token" and "Zone ID".

For the Cloudflare integration to be able to successfully get logs the following permissions must be granted to the API token -

- Account.Access: Audit Logs: Read
