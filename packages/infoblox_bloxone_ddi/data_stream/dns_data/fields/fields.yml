          type: long
          description: An unsigned 16-bit integer which specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority. The range of the value is 0 to 65535. Larger weights should be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected. Domain administrators should use weight 0 when there isn’t any server selection to do, to make the RR easier to read for humans (less noisy). In the presence of records containing weights greater than 0, records with weight 0 should have a very small chance of being selected.
