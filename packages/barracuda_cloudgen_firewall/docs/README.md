# Barracuda CloudGen Firewall integration

This integration ingests and parses logs from
[Barracuda CloudGen Firewalls](https://www.barracuda.com/products/cloudgenfirewall).

Barracuda CloudGen Firewall allows you to stream event logs from Firewall
Insights to Elastic Agent. This provides information on firewall activity,
threat logs, and information related to network, version, and location of
managed firewall units. Data is sent to Elastic Agent over a TCP connection
using CloudGen Firewall's built-in generic Logstash output.

### Setup

For a detailed walk-through of the setup steps the see
[How to Enable Filebeat Stream to a Logstash Pipeline](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/cloudgenfirewall/doc/96025953/how-to-enable-filebeat-stream-to-a-logstash-pipeline/).
These steps were written with a Logstash server as the intended destination, and
where it references the "Hostname" use the address and port of the Elastic Agent
that is running this integration. Logstash is not used as part of this
integration.

## Logs

This is the Barracuda CloudGen Firewall `log` dataset. Below is a sample
event and a list of fields that can be produced.

An example event for `log` looks as following:

```json
