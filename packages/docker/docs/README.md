# Docker Integration

This Integration collects metrics and logs from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. 
The default data streams for metrics collection are: `container`, `cpu`, `diskio`, `healthcheck`, `info`, `memory`
and `network`. The `image` metricset is not enabled by default.
The `container_logs` data stream for containers' logs collection is enabled by default.

## Compatibility

The Docker module is currently tested on Linux and Mac with the community
edition engine, versions 1.11 and 17.09.0-ce. It is not tested on Windows,
but it should also work there.

## Running from within Docker

The `docker` Integration will try to connect to the docker socket, by default at `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.
If Elastic Agent is running inside docker, you'll need to mount the unix socket inside the container:

```
docker run -d \
  --name=metricbeat \
  --user=root \
  --volume="/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro" \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat:latest metricbeat -e \
  -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["elasticsearch:9200"]
```

For log collection since the discovery of the containers happen automatically, again access to `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
will be needed so as Agent to be able to watch for Container events.
In addition, access is required to the containers' logs files which by default follows the pattern of
`/var/lib/docker/containers/${docker.container.id}/*-json.log`
If Elastic Agent is running inside docker, you'll need to mount the logs' directory too inside the container:


```
docker run -d \
  --name=metricbeat \
  --user=root \
  --volume="/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro" \
  --volume="/var/lib/docker/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers:ro" \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat:latest metricbeat -e \
  -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["elasticsearch:9200"]
```

In all cases make sure that Agent has the proper permissions to access these files.

## Module-specific configuration notes

It is strongly recommended that you run Docker metricsets with a
[`period`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/configuration-metricbeat.html#metricset-period)
that is 3 seconds or longer. The request to the
Docker API already takes up to 2 seconds. Specifying less than 3 seconds will
result in requests that timeout, and no data will be reported for those
requests.

## Metrics

### Container

The Docker `container` data stream collects information and statistics about
running Docker containers.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |  |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |  |
| host | A host is defined as a general computing instance. ECS host.\* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes. | group |  |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |  |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |  |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |  |
| host.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |  |

| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |  |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |  |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | match_only_text |  |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |  |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |  |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |  |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |  |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |  |
