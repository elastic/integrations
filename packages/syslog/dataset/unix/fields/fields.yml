- name: log.source.address
  type: keyword
  short: Syslog client network address.
  description: >
    Stores the address of the syslog client.

    Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
    sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
    store the raw address in the `.address` field.

- name: syslog
  type: group
  short: Syslog metadata
  description: >
    The Syslog metadata of the event, if the event was transmitted via Syslog.
    Please see RFCs 5424 or 3164.
  fields:
  - name: priority
    format: string
    level: extended
    type: long
    example: 135
    short: Syslog priority of the event.
    description: >
      Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available.

      According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity.
      This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191.
  - name: syslog.severity.name
    level: extended
    type: keyword
    example: Error
    short: Syslog text-based severity of the event.
    description: >
      The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available.

      If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity
      value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to `log.level`.
      If the event source does not specify a distinct severity,
      you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `log.level`.
  - name: facility
    format: string
    level: extended
    type: long
    example: 23
    short: Syslog numeric facility of the event.
    description: >
      The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available.

      According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23.
  - name: facility_label
    level: extended
    type: keyword
    example: local7
    short: Syslog text-based facility of the event.
    description: >
      The Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available.

- name: hostname
  type: keyword
  short: Hostname of the syslog client.
  description: >
    Hostname of the syslog client that published the log message.

    It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

- name: process
  title: Process
  group: 2
  type: group
  fields:
  - name: program
    level: extended
    type: keyword

      Sometimes called program name or similar.
