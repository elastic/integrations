- name: '@timestamp'
  level: core
  required: true
  type: date
  description: |-
    Date/time when the event originated.
    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
    Required field for all events.
- name: message
  level: core
  type: text
  description: |-
    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
- name: host
  title: Host
  group: 2
  type: group
  fields:
  - name: hostname
    level: core
    type: keyword
    description: |-
      Hostname of the host.
      It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

    The event fields are used for context information about the log event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
    Log events must include the time at which the thing happened.
    Examples of log events include a process starting on a host,
    a network packet being sent from a source to a destination,
    or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: severity
      type: long
      level: core
      format: string
      example: 7
      short: Numeric severity of the event.
      description: >
        The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.

        What the different severity values mean can be different between sources
        and use cases.
        It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across
        events from the same source.

        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`.
        `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to
        the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS).
        If the event source does not publish its own severity,
        you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.
    - name: sequence
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Sequence number of the event.
      description: >
        Sequence number of the event.

        The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the
        exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.
