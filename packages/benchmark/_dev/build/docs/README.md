# Benchmark

The Benchmark integration allows you to send synthetic events from `elastic-agent` to the configured output.

Use the Benchmark integration to test how fast events can be sent from `elastic-agent`. Then visualize that data in Kibana.  This can be useful when tracking down performance problems or when you want to test connectivity.

## Data streams

The Benchmark integration collects one type of data streams: logs.

**Logs** are the synthetic events

Log data streams collected by the benchmark integration include `benchmark_output.generic`. See more details in the [Logs](#logs-reference). -->


## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

Options include:

*** Message text

This is the what will appear in the `message` field of each event

*** Threads

This is the number of go routines that will be generating synthetic events.  Usually one thread is enough, but for large machines with multiple CPUs and outputs with multiple `worker` defined, it may be necessary to increase this.

*** Number of Events

Use this option if you just want to send a certain number of events and then stop.

*** Events per second

Use this option if you want to send a steady rate of events per second.  Leaving both `Number of events` and `Events per second` empty means to send as fast as possible until you remove the integration.


### benchmark_output.generic

The `benchmark_output.generic` data stream holds the synthetic events generated by this integration.
