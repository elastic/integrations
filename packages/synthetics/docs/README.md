# Elastic Synthetics
The system uses the Elastic Synthetics integration in the background to provide access to [Synthetics private locations](/app/synthetics/settings/private-locations). It is installed by default and you do not need to edit or remove this integration manually.

If you still have monitors set up with this integration, you have to [migrate them to the Synthetics app](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/synthetics-migrate-from-integration.html).

For more information on setting up and managing monitors using the new Synthetics app, check the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/monitor-uptime-synthetics.html).
