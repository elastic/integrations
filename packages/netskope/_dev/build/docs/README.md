# Netskope

This integration is for Netskope. It can be used to receive logs sent by [Netskope Cloud Log Shipper](https://docs.netskope.com/en/cloud-exchange-feature-lists.html#UUID-e7c43f4b-8aad-679e-eea0-59ce19f16e29_section-idm4547044691454432680066508785) on respective TCP ports.

The log message is expected to be in JSON format. The data is mapped to
ECS fields where applicable and the remaining fields are written under
`netskope.<data-stream-name>.*`.
