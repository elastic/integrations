          description: UCI (User Confidence Index) is one of the ways that UEBA describes how risky the user\u2019s behavior is. The lower UCI is, the more risky the user behavior is. The UCI starts from an initial value and is deducted an amount when the user\u2019s behavior is detected to be anomaly by UEBA engine. The user\u2019s UCI is daily-based, i.e. UEBA engine will create the new UCI with an initial score for users when an UTC day starts. Each user is supposed to start from 1000, but his/her previous day performance will rollover to current day and therefore impact the initial UCI.
