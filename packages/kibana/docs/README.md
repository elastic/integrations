# Kibana

The Kibana integration collects events from your [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html) instance.

## Configuration parameters

If the Kibana instance is using a basepath in its URL, you must set the `basepath` setting for this integration with the same value.

## Compatibility

The `kibana` package works with Kibana 6.7.0 and later.

## Usage for Stack Monitoring

The `kibana` package can be used to collect metrics shown in our Stack Monitoring
UI in Kibana. To enable this usage, set `xpack.enabled: true` on the package config.

## Logs

### Audit

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.

| kibana.space_id | The id of the space associated with this event. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |

| kibana.stats.usage.index |  | keyword |
| service.id | Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes. This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event. Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead. | keyword |
| service.version | Version of the service the data was collected from. This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service. | keyword |

### Cluster actions

Cluster actions metrics documentation

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| cluster_uuid |  | alias |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| kibana.cluster_actions.overdue.count |  | long |
| kibana.cluster_actions.overdue.delay.p50 |  | float |
| kibana.cluster_actions.overdue.delay.p99 |  | float |
| kibana.elasticsearch.cluster.id |  | keyword |
| kibana_stats.kibana.uuid |  | alias |
| kibana_stats.kibana.version |  | alias |
| kibana_stats.timestamp |  | alias |
| process.pid | Process id. | long |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |
| service.id | Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes. This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event. Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead. | keyword |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |
| service.version | Version of the service the data was collected from. This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service. | keyword |
| timestamp |  | alias |

### Cluster rules

Cluster rules metrics

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| cluster_uuid |  | alias |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| kibana.cluster_rules.overdue.count |  | long |
| kibana.cluster_rules.overdue.delay.p50 |  | float |
| kibana.cluster_rules.overdue.delay.p99 |  | float |
| kibana.elasticsearch.cluster.id |  | keyword |
| kibana_stats.kibana.uuid |  | alias |
| kibana_stats.kibana.version |  | alias |
| kibana_stats.timestamp |  | alias |
| process.pid | Process id. | long |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |
| service.id | Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes. This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event. Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead. | keyword |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |
| service.version | Version of the service the data was collected from. This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service. | keyword |
| timestamp |  | alias |
