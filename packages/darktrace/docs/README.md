# Darktrace

## Overview

The [Darktrace](https://darktrace.com/) integration allows you to monitor Alert Logs. Darktrace is a network solution for detecting and investigating emerging cyber-threats that evade traditional security tools. It is powered by Enterprise Immune System technology, which uses machine learning and mathematics to monitor behaviors and detect anomalies in your organization’s network.

Use the Darktrace integration to collect and parse data from the REST APIs or via Syslog. Then visualise that data in Kibana.

For example, you could use the data from this integration to know which model is breached and analyse model breaches, and also know about system health, changes in monitored traffic, and any errors experienced by Darktrace Security Modules or probe instances.

## Data streams

The Darktrace integration collects logs for three types of events: AI Analyst Alert, Model Breach Alert and System Status Alert.

**AI Analyst Alert** is generated by investigates, analyzes, and reports upon threats seen within your Darktrace environment; as a starting point, it reviews and investigates all Model Breaches that occur on the system. If behavior which would be of interest to a cyber analyst is detected, an event is created. See Example Schema [here](https://customerportal.darktrace.com/product-guides/main/syslog-aia-json-schema).

**Model Breach Alert** is generated when a model breach is triggered. A model is used to define a set of conditions which, when met, will alert the system to the occurrence of a particular event or chain of anomalous behavior. Darktrace models are focused on pattern-of-life anomaly detection, potentially malicious behavior, and compliance issues. See Example Schema [here](https://customerportal.darktrace.com/product-guides/main/syslog-json-schema).

**System Status Alert** keep Darktrace operators informed of system health, changes in monitored traffic, and any errors experienced by Darktrace Security Modules or probe instances. System Status Alerts include details of the originating host, the severity of the event, and links that may be helpful to investigate or resolve the issue. Notifications are sent for active system events and (optionally) on event resolution. See Example Schema [here](https://customerportal.darktrace.com/product-guides/main/syslog-json-system-schema).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Firewall exceptions to allow communication from the Darktrace master instance to the Syslog server.

This module has been tested against **Darktrace Threat Visualizer v5.2**.

## Setup

### To collect data from Darktrace REST APIs, follow the below steps:

1. Hostname URL will be your `<appliance-ip>`. (Threat Visualizer Console Hostname)
2. Public and Private Token will be generated by following this [Link](https://customerportal.darktrace.com/product-guides/main/api-tokens).

**Note:** System Status Alert are not supported by REST API.

### To collect data from Darktrace via Syslog, follow the below steps:

The user needs to create a different Syslog Forwarder with different ports for each data stream.

The process for configuring syslog-format alerts is identical for AI Analyst Alerts, Model Breach Alerts and System Status Alerts. Generic configuration guidance is provided below:

1. Open the Darktrace Threat Visualizer Dashboard and navigate to the **System Config** page. (**Main menu › Admin**).
2. From the left-side menu, select **Modules**, then navigate to the **Workflow Integrations** section and choose **Syslog**.
3. Select **Syslog JSON** tab and click **New** to set up new Syslog Forwarder.
4. Enter the **IP Address**  and **Port** of the Elastic Agent that is running the integration in the **Server** and **Server Port** field respectively.

For more details, see [Documentation](https://customerportal.darktrace.com/product-guides/main/json-alerts).

**Note:**
  - It is recommended to turn on **Full Timestamps** toggle in **Show Advanced Options** to get the full timestamp instead of the RFC3164-formatted timestamp.
  - It is also recommended to turn off **Reduced Message Size** toggle in **Show Advanced Options** to get more information about alerts.

### After following generic guidance steps, below are the steps for collecting individual logs for all three data streams.

#### For AI Analyst Alert, below are the suggested configurations to collect all the events of AI Analyst Alert:

- Configure the following settings in **Show Advanced Options**:

| Field Name                              | Value                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Send AI Analyst Alerts                  | ON                                  |
| Send AI Analyst Alerts Immediately      | ON                                  |
| AI Analyst Behavior Filter              | Critical, Suspicious and Compliance |
| Minimum AI Analyst Incident Event Score | 0                                   |
| Minimum AI Analyst Incident Score       | 0                                   |
| Legacy AI Analyst Alerts                | OFF                                 |

#### For Model Breach Alert, below are the suggested configurations to collect all the events of Model Breach Alert:

- Configure the following settings in **Show Advanced Options**:

| Field Name                   | Value                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Send Model Breach Alerts     | ON                                                 |

| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`). | keyword |
| event.risk_score | Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here. | float |
| event.risk_score_norm | Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100. This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems. | float |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| event.url | URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event. This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.appname | The device or application that originated the Syslog message, if available. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.facility.name | The Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available. | keyword |
| log.syslog.hostname | The hostname, FQDN, or IP of the machine that originally sent the Syslog message. This is sourced from the hostname field of the syslog header. Depending on the environment, this value may be different from the host that handled the event, especially if the host handling the events is acting as a collector. | keyword |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.name | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to `log.level`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `log.level`. | keyword |
| log.syslog.version | The version of the Syslog protocol specification. Only applicable for RFC 5424 messages. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| rule.name | The name of the rule or signature generating the event. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| threat.enrichments.matched.id | Identifies the _id of the indicator document enriching the event. | keyword |
| threat.group.id | The id of the group for a set of related intrusion activity that are tracked by a common name in the security community. While not required, you can use a MITRE ATT&CK® group id. | keyword |

| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.risk_score | Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here. | float |
| event.risk_score_norm | Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100. This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems. | float |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| event.url | URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event. This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |

| darktrace.system_status_alert.ip_address | The IP of the host experiencing the system alert. An exception exists for disconnection notices, where the IP will be of the master from which the instance has disconnected. | keyword |
| darktrace.system_status_alert.last_updated | A timestamp in epoch time that the system alert itself was updated. | date |
| darktrace.system_status_alert.last_updated_status | A timestamp in epoch time that the status of the system alert was last updated globally. A status update is distinct from a update to the alert itself. | date |
| darktrace.system_status_alert.message | A textual description of the system event that has triggered the alert. | keyword |
| darktrace.system_status_alert.name | A system name of the alert type. | keyword |

Where an alert is reactivated after resolution due to the issue reoccurring, the UUId will remain consistent across alerts. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`). | keyword |
| event.risk_score | Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here. | float |
| event.risk_score_norm | Normalized risk score or priority of the event, on a scale of 0 to 100. This is mainly useful if you use more than one system that assigns risk scores, and you want to see a normalized value across all systems. | float |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| event.url | URL linking to an external system to continue investigation of this event. This URL links to another system where in-depth investigation of the specific occurrence of this event can take place. Alert events, indicated by `event.kind:alert`, are a common use case for this field. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.appname | The device or application that originated the Syslog message, if available. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.facility.name | The Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available. | keyword |
| log.syslog.hostname | The hostname, FQDN, or IP of the machine that originally sent the Syslog message. This is sourced from the hostname field of the syslog header. Depending on the environment, this value may be different from the host that handled the event, especially if the host handling the events is acting as a collector. | keyword |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.name | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's text severity should go to `log.level`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `log.level`. | keyword |
| log.syslog.version | The version of the Syslog protocol specification. Only applicable for RFC 5424 messages. | keyword |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
