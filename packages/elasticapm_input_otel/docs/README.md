# Elastic APM Intake OpenTelemetry Input Package

## Overview

The Elastic APM Intake OpenTelemetry Input Package enables the EDOT (Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry) Collector to receive APM data from Elastic APM agents using the [elasticapmintakereceiver](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components/tree/main/receiver/elasticapmintakereceiver).

This package allows existing Elastic APM agents to send telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector instead of directly to APM Server, enabling integration with OpenTelemetry-based observability pipelines.

### How it works

This package configures the `elasticapmintakereceiver` in the EDOT Collector to accept HTTP data via the APM Intake V2 format. Elastic APM agents can then be configured to point to the collector endpoint instead of APM Server.

The receiver accepts traces, metrics, and logs from Elastic APM agents and forwards them through the OpenTelemetry pipeline for processing and export to Elasticsearch.

## What data does this integration collect?

This integration collects APM telemetry data from Elastic APM agents:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Traces | Distributed tracing data including spans and transactions |
| Metrics | Application performance metrics |
| Logs | Application logs correlated with traces |

## Compatibility

- Only the APM Intake V2 protocol is supported
- RUM (Real User Monitoring) intake and older protocols are not supported
- Compatible with Elastic APM agents that support the Intake V2 protocol

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Prerequisites

- Elastic Agent with EDOT Collector support
- Elastic APM agents configured to send data to the collector endpoint

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

### Configuration

Configure the following settings:

1. **Endpoint**: The address where the receiver listens for APM agent connections (default: `localhost:8200`)
2. **TLS Settings** (optional): Enable TLS for encrypted connections between APM agents and the receiver
3. **Agent Configuration** (optional): Enable fetching APM Central Configurations from Elasticsearch

### APM Agent Configuration

Configure your Elastic APM agents to point to the collector:

```bash
# Example environment variables for APM agents
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8200
```

For TLS-enabled connections:
```bash
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:8200
ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_CERT=/path/to/server.crt
```

### Validation

Once configured, you can verify data is being received by checking for APM documents in Elasticsearch:

1. Navigate to Kibana > Discover
2. Search for APM-related indices (e.g., `traces-*`, `metrics-*`, `logs-*`)
3. Verify that documents from your instrumented applications appear

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).

### Common Issues

- **Connection refused**: Ensure the endpoint is accessible from the APM agents
- **TLS errors**: Verify certificate paths and that the APM agent trusts the server certificate
- **No data appearing**: Check that APM agents are using the Intake V2 protocol

## Scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

## Reference

### Inputs used

This package uses the [Elastic APM Intake Receiver](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components/tree/main/receiver/elasticapmintakereceiver) from the Elastic OpenTelemetry Collector Components.
