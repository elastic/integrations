# Cassandra Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) using jolokia agent. It can parse System logs.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against `Cassandra version 3.11.11`.

### Troubleshooting

- If `log.flags` appears conflicted under the ``logs-*`` data view, this issue can be resolved by [reindexing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/use-a-data-stream.html#reindex-with-a-data-stream) the ``Logs`` data stream.

## Logs
