          By default, date times in the logs will be interpreted as UTC timezone. If the timezone of logs is different, use this field to set the timezone offset so that date times are correctly parsed. Acceptable timezone formats the canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam").

          The request tracer logs HTTP requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging.
