# Box Events Integration

The Box Events integration allows you to monitor [Box](https://app.box.com/). Box is a secure cloud storage and collaboration service that allows businesses and individuals to easily share files. 

Use the Box Events integration to ingest the activity logs which are generated each time files are uploaded, accessed, or modified in Box, enabling you to monitor data movement to the cloud. If you have [opted-in to receive additional events](https://developer.box.com/guides/events/event-triggers/shield-alert-events/), the Box Events integration will ingest context-rich alerts on potential threats, such as compromised accounts and data theft, based on anomalous user behavior. Combining this data with other events can lead to the detection of data exfiltration attacks.

Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference `box_events.events` when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to set up notifications for incoming Box Shield alerts you could verify that this data is being ingested from the `Box Shield Alerts` Dashboard. Then, go to `Alerts and Insights / Rules and Connectors` in the sidebar and set up a Rule using an Elasticsearch Query against index `*box*alert*` with time field `@timestamp` and DSL 

```
{
  "query":{
    "match" : {
      "event.kind": "alert"
    }
  }
}
```

to match incoming box alerts during your desired timeframe and notify you using your preferred connector.

## Compatibility

The Box Web Application does not feature version numbers, see this [Community Post](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000033881/comments/1500000038001). This integration was configured and tested against Box in the second quarter of 2022.

## Box Events

The Box events API enables subscribing to live events across the enterprise or for a particular user, or querying historical events across the enterprise.

The API Returns up to a year of past events for configurable to the `admin` user (default) or for the entire enterprise.

### Elastic Integration for Box Events Settings

The Elastic Integration for Box Events requires the following Authentication Settings in order to connect to the Target service:
  - Client ID
  - Client Secret
  - Box Subject ID
  - Box Subject Type
  - Grant Type

The Elastic Integration for Box Events requires the following Data Stream Settings to configure the request to the Target API:
  - Interval
  - Stream Type
  - Preserve Original Event

Here is a brief guide to help you generate these settings

### Target Repository Authentication Settings Prerequisites
The Elastic Integration for Box Events connects using OAuth 2.0 to interact with a Box Custom App. As prerequisites you will need to:
  - Enable `MFA/2FA` on your admin account by following the instructions in [MFA Setup on Box Support](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697154-Multi-Factor-Authentication-Set-Up-for-Your-Account)
  - Configure a `Box Custom Application using Server Authentication `    
  `(with Client Credentials Grant)`. A suggested workflow is provided below, see [Setup with OAuth 2.0](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup/) for additional information.

### Authorized User
It is important to login to the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) as an `admin` and not `co-admin`.

## A suggested workflow is as follows:

### Create a `Custom Application using Server Authentication (with Client Credentials Grant) authentication`
  1. Open the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console)
  2. Click on `Create new App`
  3. Click on `Custom App`
  4. Select `Server Authentication (Client Credentials Grant)`
  5. Provide an App name, for example `elastic-box-integration`
  6. Click on `Create App` 
  7. When your App has been created, scroll down and under `App Access Level` select `App + Enterprise Access`
  8. Scroll down to `Application Scopes` and under `Administrative Actions` select 
    - `Manage users`
    - `Manage enterprise properties`
  9. Scroll down to `Advanced Features` and select 
    - `Generate user access tokens`
  10. Click on `Save Changes`

### Submit the application for Authorization from the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console)
  1. In the left side bar, at the bottom, click on `</> Dev Console`
  2. Click on your application, which should now have an extra `Authorization` tab, so click on this
  3. Click on `Review and Submit`, add a comment to explain your changes then click on `Submit`.

### Authorize the Application from the [Box Admin Console](https://app.box.com/master)
If you are the `admin` user you can do this yourself, otherwise reach out to the admin to confirm your motives and request that they authorize your request, since there may be some delay before they are aware of your request.

To authorize the App ensure you are logged in to the [Admin Console](https://app.box.com/master) and follow these steps:

  1. In the left side bar click on [Apps](https://app.box.com/master/settings/apps)
  2. Click on the [Custom Apps Manager](https://app.box.com/master/custom-apps) tab, you should see your App under `Server Authentication Apps` and the `Authorisation Status` should be `Pending Reauth`
  3. Click on your App, it should have the following `App Details`:
    - Last Activity
      - `<date>`
    - Developer Email
      - `<your email>`
    - Authorization Status
      - `Pending Reauthorization`
    - Enablement Status
      - `Enabled`
    - Client ID
      - `<alphanumeric id>`
    - App Access
      - `All Users`
    - App Scopes
      - `Read and write all files and folders stored in Box`
      - `Manage enterprise properties`
      - `Manage users`
      - `Manage app users`
      - `Generate user access tokens`
    - Authentication Type
      - `OAuth 2.0 with Client Credentials Grant`
  4. Click on `Authorize` - a pop up will reconfirm these details
  5. Click on `Authorize` - the Authorization Status should update to 
    - Authorized

### Locate the Elastic Integration for Box Events Settings

#### Client ID
Click on your App in the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), under the `Configuration` tab, scroll down to `OAuth 2.0 Credentials` and copy the `Client ID`

####  Client Secret
Have your 2FA device prepared and to hand. Click on your App in the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), under the `Configuration` tab, scroll down to `OAuth 2.0 Credentials` and click on `Fetch Client Secret`. Complete the 2FA challenge to copy the `Client Secret`

####  Box Subject ID
Click on your App in the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), under the `General Settings` tab, scroll down to `App Info`. If you intend to harvest events solely for the `admin` user copy the `User ID` otherwise copy the `Enterprise ID`

####  Box Subject Type
If you intend to harvest events solely for the `admin` user set this to `user` otherwise set to `enterprise`

####  Grant Type
Use the provided default `client_credentials`

####  Interval
This sets the interval between requests to the Target Service, for example `300s` will send a request every 300 seconds. Events will be returned in batches of up to 100, with successive calls on expiry of the configured `interval` so you may wish to specify a lower interval when a substantial number of events are expected, however, we suggest to consider bandwidth when using lower settings

####  Stream Type
To retrieve events for a single user, set stream type to `all` (default). To select only events that may cause file tree changes such as file updates or collaborations, use `changes`. To select a subset of `changes` for synced folders, use `sync`. To retrieve events for the entire enterprise, set the stream_type to `admin_logs_streaming` for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across historical events.

####  Preserve Original Event
Preserves a raw copy of the original event, added to the field `event.original`.

| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.risk_score | Risk score or priority of the event (e.g. security solutions). Use your system's original value here. | float |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.created | File creation time. Note that not all filesystems store the creation time. | date |
| file.ctime | Last time the file attributes or metadata changed. Note that changes to the file content will update `mtime`. This implies `ctime` will be adjusted at the same time, since `mtime` is an attribute of the file. | date |
| file.directory | Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.hash.sha1 | SHA1 hash. | keyword |
| file.mtime | Last time the file content was modified. | date |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.size | File size in bytes. Only relevant when `file.type` is "file". | long |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.cpu.pct | Percent CPU used. This value is normalized by the number of CPU cores and it ranges from 0 to 1. | scaled_float |
| host.disk.read.bytes | The total number of bytes read successfully in a given period of time. | long |
| host.disk.write.bytes | The total number of bytes write successfully in a given period of time. | long |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.network.in.bytes | The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the host in a given period of time. | long |
| host.network.in.packets | The number of packets received on all network interfaces by the host in a given period of time. | long |
| host.network.out.bytes | The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the host in a given period of time. | long |
| host.network.out.packets | The number of packets sent out on all network interfaces by the host in a given period of time. | long |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| related.description | Array of `description` derived from `threat[.enrichments].indicator.description` | keyword |
| related.hash | All the hashes seen on your event. Populating this field, then using it to search for hashes can help in situations where you're unsure what the hash algorithm is (and therefore which key name to search). | keyword |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
