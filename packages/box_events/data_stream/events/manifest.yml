        title: Interval
        description: This sets the interval between requests to the Target Service, for example `300s` will send a request every 300 seconds. Events will be returned in batches of up to 100, with successive calls on expiry of the configured `interval` so you may wish to specify a lower interval when a substantial number of events are expected, however, we suggest to consider bandwidth when using lower settings. Supported units for this parameter are h/m/s.

        description: >-
          To retrieve events for a single user, set stream type to `all` (default). To select only events that may cause file tree changes such as file updates or collaborations, use `changes`. To select a subset of `changes` for synced folders, use `sync`. To retrieve events for the entire enterprise, set the stream_type to `admin_logs_streaming` for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across historical events.
