      Paths (directories or files) to watch. Globs are not supported. The specified
      paths should exist when the module is started. Paths should be absolute,
      although the file integrity module will attempt to resolve relative path events to
      their absolute file path. Symbolic links are resolved at startup.

      Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata.
      This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed.
      See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
