# Load Balancing

## Metrics

The `loadbalancing_metrics` dataset fetches HTTPS, HTTP, and Layer 3 metrics from [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Load Balancing Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-loadbalancing).

An example event for `loadbalancing` looks as following:

```json

    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud | Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events are coming from. | group |

| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
