# Load Balancing

## Logs

The `loadbalancing_logs` dataset collects logs of the requests sent to and handled by GCP Load Balancers.

An example event for `loadbalancing` looks as following:

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |

For example, a cache response served from a cache in Amsterdam would have a cacheId value of AMS-85e2bd4b, where AMS is the IATA code, and 85e2bd4b is an opaque identifier of the cache instance  (because some Cloud CDN locations have multiple discrete caches). | keyword |

| gcp.load_balancer.forwarding_rule_name | The name of the forwarding rule | keyword |
| gcp.load_balancer.status_details | Explains why the load balancer returned the HTTP status that it did. See https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/cdn-logging-monitoring#statusdetail_http_success_messages for specific messages. | keyword |
| gcp.load_balancer.target_proxy_name | The target proxy name | keyword |
| gcp.load_balancer.url_map_name | The URL map name | keyword |

## Metrics

The `loadbalancing_metrics` dataset fetches HTTPS, HTTP, and Layer 3 metrics from [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Load Balancing Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-loadbalancing).

An example event for `loadbalancing` looks as following:
