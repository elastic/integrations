# Compute

## Metrics

The `compute` dataset is designed to fetch metrics for [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-compute).

Extra labels and metadata are also extracted using the [Compute API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/get). This is enough to get most of the info associated with a metric like Compute labels and metadata and metric specific Labels.

## Sample Event

An example event for `compute` looks as following:

```json
