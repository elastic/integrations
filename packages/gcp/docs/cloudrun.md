# Cloud Run

The `cloudrun` dataset fetches metrics from [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains metrics exported from the [GCP Cloud Run Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-run).

## Metrics

An example event for `cloudrun` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {

| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |  |
| error | These fields can represent errors of any kind. Use them for errors that happen while fetching events or in cases where the event itself contains an error. | group |  |  |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |  |  |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |  |  |
| gcp.cloudrun_metrics.container.billable_instance_time | Delta of billable time aggregated across all container instances.

| gcp.cloudrun_metrics.request_latencies | Distribution of request latency in milliseconds reaching the revision. Latency is measured from when the request reaches the running container to when it exits. Notably, it does not include container startup latency. | object |  |  |
| gcp.labels.metadata.\* |  | object |  |  |

| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |  |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |  |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |  |  |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |  |  |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |  |  |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |  |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |  |  |
