# Billing

## Metrics

The `billing` dataset collects [Cloud Billing Reports](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reports) information from Google Cloud BigQuery daily cost detail table. BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse. Cloud Billing export to BigQuery enables you to export detailed Google Cloud billing data (such as usage, cost estimates, and pricing data) automatically throughout the day to a BigQuery dataset that you specify. Then you can access your Cloud Billing data from BigQuery for detailed analysis.

Please see [export cloud billing data to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery) for more details on how to export billing data.

In BigQuery dataset, detailed Google Cloud daily cost data is loaded into a data table named `gcp_billing_export_v1_<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>`. There is a defined schema for Google Cloud daily cost data that is exported to BigQuery. Please see [daily cost detail data schema](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery-tables#data-schema) for more details.

| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error | These fields can represent errors of any kind. Use them for errors that happen while fetching events or in cases where the event itself contains an error. | group |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| gcp.billing.billing_account_id | Project Billing Account ID. | keyword |

| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |

| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
