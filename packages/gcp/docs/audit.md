# Audit

## Logs

The `audit` dataset collects audit logs of administrative activities and accesses within your Google Cloud resources.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| container.runtime | Runtime managing this container. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.authentication_info.authority_selector | The authority selector specified by the requestor, if any. It is not guaranteed  that the principal was allowed to use this authority. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.authentication_info.principal_email | The email address of the authenticated user making the request. | keyword |

| gcp.audit.authorization_info.resource_attributes.service | The name of the service. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.authorization_info.resource_attributes.type | The type of the resource. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.method_name | The name of the service method or operation. For API calls, this  should be the name of the API method.  For example, 'google.datastore.v1.Datastore.RunQuery'. | keyword |

| gcp.audit.resource_location.current_locations | Current locations of the resource. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.resource_name | The resource or collection that is the target of the operation.  The name is a scheme-less URI, not including the API service name.  For example, 'shelves/SHELF_ID/books'. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.response.details.group | The name of the group. | keyword |

| gcp.audit.service_name | The name of the API service performing the operation.  For example, datastore.googleapis.com. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.status.code | The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code. | integer |

| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
