# Redis

## Metrics

The `redis` dataset fetches metrics from [Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Redis Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-redis).

## Sample Event
    
An example event for `redis` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {
            "id": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev",
            "name": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev"
        },
        "instance": {
            "id": "4751091017865185079",

                }
            }
        },
        "labels": {
            "user": {
                "goog-gke-node": ""
            }
        }
    },
    "host": {
        "id": "4751091017865185079",

    },

        "type": "gcp"
    }
}
```
