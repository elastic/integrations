# Google Cloud Platform Integration

The Google Cloud integration collects and parses Google Cloud [Audit Logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit), [VPC Flow Logs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs), [Firewall Rules Logs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewall-rules-logging) and [Cloud DNS Logs](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/monitoring) that have been exported from Cloud Logging to a Google Pub/Sub topic sink.

## Authentication

To use this Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration, you need to set up a
*Service Account* with a *Role* and a *Service Account Key* to access data on
your GCP project.

### Service Account

First, you need to [create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts). A Service Account (SA) is a particular type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user who needs to access the GCP resources.

The Elastic Agent uses the SA to access data on Google Cloud Platform using the Google APIs.

If you haven't already, this might be a good moment to check out the [best
practices for securing service
accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-securing-service-accounts)
guide.

### Role

You need to grant your Service Account (SA) access to Google Cloud Platform
resources by assigning a role to the account. In order to assign minimal
privileges, create a custom role that has only the privileges required by Agent.
Those privileges are:

- `pubsub.subscriptions.consume`
- `pubsub.subscriptions.create` *
- `pubsub.subscriptions.get`
- `pubsub.topics.attachSubscription` *

\* Only required if Agent is expected to create a new subscription. If you
create the subscriptions yourself you may omit these privileges.

After you have created the custom role, assign the role to your service account.

### Service Account Keys

Now, with your brand new Service Account (SA) with access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources, you need some credentials to associate with it: a Service Account Key.

From the list of SA:

1. Click the one you just created to open the detailed view.
2. From the Keys section, click "Add key" > "Create new key" and select JSON as the type.
3. Download and store the generated private key securely (remember, the private key can't be recovered from GCP if lost).

## Configure the Integration Settings

The next step is to configure the general integration settings used for all logs from the supported services (Audit, DNS, Firewall, and VPC Flow).

The "Project Id" and either the "Credentials File" or "Credentials JSON" will need to be provided in the integration UI when adding the Google Cloud Platform integration.

### Project Id

The Project Id is the Google Cloud project ID where your resources exist.

### Credentials File vs Json

Based on your preference, specify the information in either the Credentials File OR the Credentials JSON field.

#### Option 1: Credentials File

Save the JSON file with the private key in a secure location of the file system, and make sure that the Elastic Agent has at least read-only privileges to this file.

Specify the file path in the Elastic Agent integration UI in the "Credentials File" field. For example: `/home/ubuntu/credentials.json`.

#### Option 2: Credentials JSON

Specify the content of the JSON file you downloaded from Google Cloud Platform directly in the Credentials JSON field in the Elastic Agent integration.

#### Recommendations

Elastic recommends using Credentials File, as in this method the credential information doesnâ€™t leave your Google Cloud Platform environment. When using Credentials JSON, the integration stores the info in Elasticsearch, and the access is controlled based on policy permissions or access to underlying Elasticsearch data.

## Logs Collection Configuration

With a properly configured Service Account and the integration setting in place, it's time to start collecting some logs.

### Requirements

You need to create a few dedicated Google Cloud resources before starting, in detail:

- Log Sink
- Pub/Sub Topic
- Subscription

Elastic recommends separate Pub/Sub topics for each of the log types so that they can be parsed and stored in a specific data stream.

Here's an example of collecting Audit Logs using a Pub/Sub topic, a subscription, and a Log Router. We will create the resources in the Google Cloud Console and then configure the Google Cloud Platform integration.

### On the Google Cloud Console

At a high level, the steps required are:

- Visit "Logging" > "Log Router" > "Create Sink" and provide a sink name and description.
- In "Sink destination", select "Cloud Pub/Sub topic" as the sink service. Select an existing topic or "Create a topic". Note the topic name, as it will be provided in the Topic field in the Elastic agent configuration.
- If you created a new topic, you must remember to go to that topic and create a subscription for it. A subscription directs messages on a topic to subscribers. Note the "Subscription ID", as it will need to be entered in the "Subscription name" field in the integration settings.
- Under "Choose logs to include in sink", for example add `logName:"cloudaudit.googleapis.com"` in the "Inclusion filter" to include all audit logs.

This is just an example; you will need to create your filter expression to select the log types you want to export to the Pub/Sub topic.

More example filters for different log types:

```text
#
# VPC Flow: logs for specific subnet
#
resource.type="gce_subnetwork" AND
log_id("compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows") AND
resource.labels.subnetwork_name"=[SUBNET_NAME]"
#
# Audit: Google Compute Engine firewall rule deletion
#
resource.type="gce_firewall_rule" AND
log_id("cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity") AND
protoPayload.methodName:"firewalls.delete"
#
# DNS: all DNS queries
#
resource.type="dns_query"
#
# Firewall: logs for a given country
#
resource.type="gce_subnetwork" AND
log_id("compute.googleapis.com/firewall") AND
jsonPayload.remote_location.country=[COUNTRY_ISO_ALPHA_3]
```

Start working on your query using the Google Cloud [Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query), so you can preview and pinpoint the exact log types you want to forward to your Elastic Stack.

To learn more, please read how to [Build queries in the Logs Explorer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/building-queries), and take a look at the [Sample queries using the Logs Explorer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/query-library-preview) page in the Google Cloud docs.

### On Kibana

Visit "Management" > "Integrations" > "Installed Integrations" > "Google Cloud Platform" and select the "Integration Policies" tab. Select the integration policy you previously created.

From the list of services, select "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) audit logs (gcp-pubsub)" and:

- On the "Topic" field, specify the "topic name" you noted before on the Google Cloud Console.
- On the "Subscription Name", specify the short subscription name you noted before on the Google Cloud Console (note: do NOT use the full-blown subscription name made of project/PROJECT_ID/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID). Just pick the Subscription ID from the Google Cloud Console).
- Click on "Save Integration", and make sure the Elastic Agent gets the updated policy.

### Troubleshooting

If you don't see Audit logs showing up, check the Agent logs to see if there are errors.

Common error types:

- Missing roles in the Service Account
- Misconfigured settings, like "Project Id", "Topic" or "Subscription Name" fields

#### Missing Roles in the Service Account

If your Service Account (SA) does not have the required roles, you might find errors like this one in the `elastic_agent.filebeat` dataset:

```text
failed to subscribe to pub/sub topic: failed to check if subscription exists: rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = User not authorized to perform this action.
```

Solution: make sure your SA has all the required roles.

#### Misconfigured Settings

If you specify the wrong "Topic field" or "Subscription Name", you might find errors like this one in the `elastic_agent.filebeat` dataset:

```text
[elastic_agent.filebeat][error] failed to subscribe to pub/sub topic: failed to check if subscription exists: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = Invalid resource name given (name=projects/project/subscriptions/projects/project/subscriptions/non-existent-sub). Refer to https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names for more information.
```

Solution: double check the integration settings.

## Logs

### Audit

The `audit` dataset collects audit logs of administrative activities and accesses within your Google Cloud resources.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| client.user.email | User email address. | keyword |
| client.user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| container.runtime | Runtime managing this container. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.code | Error code describing the error. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.authentication_info.authority_selector | The authority selector specified by the requestor, if any. It is not guaranteed  that the principal was allowed to use this authority. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.authentication_info.principal_email | The email address of the authenticated user making the request. | keyword |

| gcp.audit.logentry_operation.id | Optional. An arbitrary operation identifier. Log entries with the same identifier are assumed to be part of the same operation. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.logentry_operation.last | Optional. Set this to True if this is the last log entry in the operation. | boolean |
| gcp.audit.logentry_operation.producer | Optional. An arbitrary producer identifier. The combination of id and producer must be globally unique. | keyword |
| gcp.audit.method_name | The name of the service method or operation. For API calls, this  should be the name of the API method.  For example, 'google.datastore.v1.Datastore.RunQuery'. | keyword |

| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |

| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.logger | The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |

| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| container.runtime | Runtime managing this container. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| destination.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| destination.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| destination.domain | The domain name of the destination system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| destination.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| gcp.destination.instance.project_id | ID of the project containing the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.destination.instance.region | Region of the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.destination.instance.zone | Zone of the VM. | keyword |

| gcp.firewall.rule_details.ip_port_info | List of ip protocols and applicable port ranges for rules. | array |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.priority | The priority for the firewall rule. | long |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.reference | Reference to the firewall rule. | keyword |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.source_range | List of source ranges that the firewall rule applies to. | keyword |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.source_service_account | List of all the source service accounts that the firewall rule applies to. | keyword |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.source_tag | List of all the source tags that the firewall rule applies to. | keyword |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.target_service_account | List of all the target service accounts that the firewall rule applies to. | keyword |
| gcp.firewall.rule_details.target_tag | List of all the target tags that the firewall rule applies to. | keyword |
| gcp.source.instance.project_id | ID of the project containing the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.source.instance.region | Region of the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.source.instance.zone | Zone of the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.source.vpc.project_id | ID of the project containing the VM. | keyword |
| gcp.source.vpc.subnetwork_name | Subnetwork on which the VM is operating. | keyword |
| gcp.source.vpc.vpc_name | VPC on which the VM is operating. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.logger | The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |
| network.name | Name given by operators to sections of their network. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| related.hash | All the hashes seen on your event. Populating this field, then using it to search for hashes can help in situations where you're unsure what the hash algorithm is (and therefore which key name to search). | keyword |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| rule.name | The name of the rule or signature generating the event. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `source.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| source.domain | The domain name of the source system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |

If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |

| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |

### DNS

The `dns` dataset collects queries that name servers resolve for your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, as well as queries from an external entity directly to a public zone.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| dns.answers | An array containing an object for each answer section returned by the server. The main keys that should be present in these objects are defined by ECS. Records that have more information may contain more keys than what ECS defines. Not all DNS data sources give all details about DNS answers. At minimum, answer objects must contain the `data` key. If more information is available, map as much of it to ECS as possible, and add any additional fields to the answer objects as custom fields. | object |
| dns.answers.class | The class of DNS data contained in this resource record. | keyword |
| dns.answers.data | The data describing the resource. The meaning of this data depends on the type and class of the resource record. | keyword |
| dns.answers.name | The domain name to which this resource record pertains. If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated. | keyword |
| dns.answers.ttl | The time interval in seconds that this resource record may be cached before it should be discarded. Zero values mean that the data should not be cached. | long |
| dns.answers.type | The type of data contained in this resource record. | keyword |
| dns.question.name | The name being queried. If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively. | keyword |
| dns.question.registered_domain | The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.subdomain | The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain. If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| dns.question.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| dns.resolved_ip | Array containing all IPs seen in `answers.data`. The `answers` array can be difficult to use, because of the variety of data formats it can contain. Extracting all IP addresses seen in there to `dns.resolved_ip` makes it possible to index them as IP addresses, and makes them easier to visualize and query for. | ip |
| dns.response_code | The DNS response code. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.auth_answer | Authoritative answer. | boolean |
| gcp.dns.destination_ip | Destination IP address, only applicable for forwarding cases. | ip |
| gcp.dns.egress_error | Egress proxy error. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.protocol | Protocol TCP or UDP. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.query_name | DNS query name. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.query_type | DNS query type. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.rdata | DNS answer in presentation format, truncated to 260 bytes. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.response_code | Response code. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.server_latency | Server latency. | integer |
| gcp.dns.source_ip | Source IP address of the query. | ip |
| gcp.dns.source_network | Source network of the query. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.source_type | Type of source generating the DNS query: private-zone, public-zone, forwarding-zone, forwarding-policy, peering-zone, internal, external, internet | keyword |
| gcp.dns.target_type | Type of target resolving the DNS query: private-zone, public-zone, forwarding-zone, forwarding-policy, peering-zone, internal, external, internet | keyword |
| gcp.dns.vm_instance_id | Compute Engine VM instance ID, only applicable to queries initiated by Compute Engine VMs. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.vm_instance_name | Compute Engine VM instance name, only applicable to queries initiated by Compute Engine VMs. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.vm_project_id | Google Cloud project ID, only applicable to queries initiated by Compute Engine VMs. | keyword |
| gcp.dns.vm_zone_name | Google Cloud VM zone, only applicable to queries initiated by Compute Engine VMs. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |

| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.logger | The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
