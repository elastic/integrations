# Firestore

## Metrics

The `firestore` dataset fetches metrics from [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Firestore Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-firestore).

You can specify a single region to fetch metrics like `us-central1`. Be aware that GCP Storage does not use zones so `us-central1-a` will return nothing. If no region is specified, it will return metrics from all buckets.

## Sample Event
    
An example event for `firestore` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {
            "id": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev",
            "name": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev"
        },
        "instance": {

        },

        },
        "provider": "gcp",

                },
                "read": {
                    "count": 10
                },
                "write": {
                    "count": 1
                }
            }
        },
        "labels": {
            "user": {
                "goog-gke-node": ""
            }
        }
    },
    "host": {
        "id": "4751091017865185079",
        "name": "gke-cluster-1-default-pool-6617a8aa-5clh"
    },
    "metricset": {
        "name": "firestore",
        "period": 10000
    },
    "service": {
        "type": "gcp"
    }
}
```

## Exported fields

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud | Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events are coming from. | group |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.account.name | The cloud account name or alias used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account name, Google Cloud ORG display name. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error | These fields can represent errors of any kind. Use them for errors that happen while fetching events or in cases where the event itself contains an error. | group |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| gcp.firestore.document.delete.count | The number of successful document deletes. | long |
| gcp.firestore.document.read.count | The number of successful document reads from queries or lookups. | long |
| gcp.firestore.document.write.count | The number of successful document writes. | long |
| gcp.labels.metadata.\* |  | object |
| gcp.labels.metrics.\* |  | object |
| gcp.labels.resource.\* |  | object |

| gcp.labels.user.\* |  | object |
| gcp.metrics.\*.\*.\*.\* | Metrics that returned from Google Cloud API query. | object |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |

| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
