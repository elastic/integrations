# Storage

## Metrics

The `storage` dataset fetches metrics from [Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Storage Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-storage).

You can specify a single region to fetch metrics like `us-central1`. Be aware that GCP Storage does not use zones so `us-central1-a` will return nothing. If no region is specified, it will return metrics from all buckets.

## Sample Event
    
An example event for `storage` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {

            }
        },
        "labels": {
            "user": {

    },
    "metricset": {

        "period": 10000
    },
    "service": {
        "type": "gcp"
    }
}
```

## Exported fields

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud | Fields related to the cloud or infrastructure the events are coming from. | group |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.account.name | The cloud account name or alias used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account name, Google Cloud ORG display name. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
