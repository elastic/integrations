        Move configurations to support metrics. This change is breaking, as it moves
        some configuration from the top level variables to data stream variables.

        This change involves `project_id`, `credentials_file` and `credentials_json`
        variables that are moved from input level configuration to package level
        configuration (as those variables are reused across all inputs/data streams).

        Users with GCP integration enabled will need to input values for these
        variables again when upgrading the policies to this version.
