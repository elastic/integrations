# PubSub

## Metrics

The `pubsub` dataset fetches metrics from [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP PubSub Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-pubsub).

You can specify a single region to fetch metrics like `us-central1`. Be aware that GCP PubSub does not use zones so `us-central1-a` will return nothing. If no region is specified, it will return metrics from all buckets.
