        description: >-
          Keeps a copy of the original document as a JSON field for processing in `@custom` pipelines. Any fields that are in the original GCP document may renamed, copied or otherwire unprocessed from the field's path relative to `gcp.firewall.flattened`. GCP documents may be large and so will potentially add significant storage cost if retained after completion of the ingest pipeline. It is the responsibility of the user to remove the `gcp.firewall.flattened` field after `@custom` pipeline processors have been executed if the complete flattened field is not needed. It is not recommended to permanently retain the flattened field and also set Preserve Original Event as this will duplicate the storage of the original data.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
