    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
        Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
        Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
        Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.
