# Microsoft DNS Server Audit and Analytical logs

The Elastic integration for DNS Server logs is designed to facilitate the collection, aggregation, and analysis of DNS logs from both Audit and Analytical categories. By capturing detailed DNS event data, this integration enables organizations to enhance their visibility into DNS transactions, detect potential security threats, and optimize their network performance. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Elastic Stack, this integration provides real-time insights and analytics, empowering IT and security teams to quickly respond to incidents and maintain robust network infrastructure integrity.

## Data streams

The Microsoft DNS Server integration collects two type of data: audit and analytical.

**Analytical** events represent the bulk of DNS events, an analytic event is logged each time the server sends or receives DNS information.

**Audit** events enable change tracking on the DNS server. An audit event is logged each time server, zone, or resource record settings are changed. This includes operational events such as dynamic updates, zone transfers, and DNSSEC zone signing and unsigning.

## Requirements

- Elastic Agent must be installed.
- You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

You have a few options for installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

There are some minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent and for more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

This integration is supported in every Windows versions supported by [`Filebeat`](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix), starting from Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.

The minimum **kibana.version** required is **8.13.0**.

## Configuration
 
DNS analytical events are not enabled by default. To enable it, you can follow the [guide to enable DNS diagnostics logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn800669(v=ws.11)#to-enable-dns-diagnostic-logging) of Microsoft's documentation.

**Note:**  DNS logging and diagnostics feature in Windows is designed to have a very low impact on performance. However, according to the [Audit and analytic event logging section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn800669(v=ws.11)#audit-and-analytic-event-logging) of the docs, typically will only affect DNS server performance at very high DNS query rates. For example, a DNS server running on modern hardware that is receiving 100,000 queries per second (QPS) can experience a performance degradation of 5% when analytic logs are enabled.

## Usage

**DNS Analytical** events are collected through [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-etw.html), a mechanism that allows real-time logging and capturing of Windows system events. This collection can be done either by initiating a new ETW session to gather logs directly from the DNS Server provider or by reading pre-existing logs from a .etl (Event Trace Log) file.

This integration provides a native filtering mechanism called `Match All Keyword`. This filter uses a 64-bit bitmask to specify which events to capture based on their defined keywords. Each keyword corresponds to a specific type of event detailed in the DNS Server provider's manifest.

To view these keywords and understand what types of events can be traced, you can run the following command in a command prompt: `logman query providers "Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer"`. Here is an example of the output:

```text
PS> logman query providers "Microsoft-Windows-DNSServer"

The command completed successfully.
```

The output lists various event types with corresponding keywords, allowing you to select which events to monitor. For example, if you want to track recursive queries, you would look for keywords like `RECURSE_QUERY_OUT`, `RECURSE_RESPONSE_IN`, and `RECURSE_QUERY_DROP`. To set up filtering for these specific events, you would calculate the sum of their bitmask values. The result for this particular case would be `0x8000000000000070` (notice that it includes `0x8000000000000000` to match Analytical events as well).

On the other hand, **Audit** events are exposed through Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server/Audit event log channel.
