# Apache Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) servers. It can parse access and error
logs created by the Apache server.

## Compatibility

The Apache datasets were tested with Apache 2.4.12 and 2.4.46 and are expected to work with
all versions >= 2.2.31 and >= 2.4.16 (independent from operating system).

## Logs

### Access Logs

Access logs collects the Apache access logs.

{{fields "access"}}

### Error Logs

Error logs collects the Apache error logs.

{{fields "error"}}

## Metrics

### Status Metrics

The server status stream collects data from the Apache Status module. It scrapes the status data from the web page
generated by the `mod_status` module.

{{event "status"}}

{{fields "status"}}

## ML Modules

These anomaly detection jobs are available in the Machine Learning app in Kibana
when you have data that matches the query specified in the
[manifest](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/apache/kibana/ml_module/apache-Logs-ml.json#L11).

### Apache Access Logs

Find unusual activity in HTTP access logs.

| Job | Description |

| status_code_rate_apache | HTTP Access Logs: Detect unusual status code rates |
| source_ip_url_count_apache | HTTP Access Logs: Detect unusual source IPs - high distinct count of URLs |
| source_ip_request_rate_apache | HTTP Access Logs: Detect unusual source IPs - high request rates |
| low_request_rate_apache | HTTP Access Logs: Detect low request rates |
