          The request tracer logs requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations.
          Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging. Disabling the request
          tracer will delete any stored traces.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
