# 1Password Events Reporting

With [1Password Business](https://support.1password.com/explore/business/), you can send your account activity to your security information and event management (SIEM) system, using the 1Password Events API. 

Get reports about 1Password activity, such as sign-in attempts and item usage, while you manage all your company’s applications and services from a central location.

With 1Password Events Reporting and Elastic SIEM, you can:

-	Control your 1Password data retention
-	Build custom graphs and dashboards
-	Set up custom alerts that trigger specific actions
-	Cross-reference 1Password events with the data from other services

You can set up Events Reporting if you’re an owner or administrator.
