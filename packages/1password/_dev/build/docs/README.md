# 1Password Events Reporting

With [1Password Business](https://support.1password.com/explore/business/), you can send your account activity to your security information and event management (SIEM) system, using the 1Password Events API. 

Get reports about 1Password activity, such as sign-in attempts and item usage, while you manage all your company’s applications and services from a central location.

With 1Password Events Reporting and Elastic SIEM, you can:

-	Control your 1Password data retention
-	Build custom graphs and dashboards
-	Set up custom alerts that trigger specific actions
-	Cross-reference 1Password events with the data from other services

You can set up Events Reporting if you’re an owner or administrator.

## Agentless Enabled Integration

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).
Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
