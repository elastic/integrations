# 1Password Events Reporting

With [1Password Business](https://support.1password.com/explore/business/), you can send your account activity to your security information and event management (SIEM) system, using the 1Password Events API. 

Get reports about 1Password activity, such as sign-in attempts and item usage, while you manage all your company’s applications and services from a central location.

With 1Password Events Reporting and Elastic SIEM, you can:

-	Control your 1Password data retention
-	Build custom graphs and dashboards
-	Set up custom alerts that trigger specific actions
-	Cross-reference 1Password events with the data from other services

You can set up Events Reporting if you’re an owner or administrator.

## Elastic Managed enabled integration

Elastic Managed integrations are only supported on Elastic Cloud Serverless and Elastic Cloud Hosted deployments. An Elastic Managed integration lets you ingest data from a cloud source while avoiding the orchestration, management, and maintenance associated with standard ingest infrastructure. Elastic runs the collector for you, so you can focus on your data instead of the infrastructure that collects it. This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

For more information, refer to [Elastic Managed integrations](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations) and the [Elastic Managed integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations-faq).
