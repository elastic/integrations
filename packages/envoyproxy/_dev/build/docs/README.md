# Envoy Proxy

This integration is for Envoy proxy [access logs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.10.0/configuration/access_log) and [statsd metrics](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/stats_overview). It supports both standalone deployment and Envoy proxy deployment in Kubernetes.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Setup

### Logs

Update the path to your logs in the integration if access logs are not being written to `/var/log/envoy.log` (default location).

For Kubernetes deployment see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-kubernetes-autodiscovery.html) for autodiscovery with Elastic Agent.

### Stats

Update your Envoy config to point statsd output to the IP address of the agent running this integration.

> NOTE: Hostnames are not supported by Envoy and must use the IP address where Elastic Agent is installed

```yaml
stats_sinks:
  - name: graphite_statsd
    typed_config:
      "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.stat_sinks.graphite_statsd.v3.GraphiteStatsdSink
      address:
        socket_address:
          address: 127.0.0.1
          port_value: 8125
