# Envoy Proxy

This integration is for Envoy proxy access log (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.10.0/configuration/access_log). It supports both standalone deployment and Envoy proxy deployment in Kubernetes. 

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.
