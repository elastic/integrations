        Add `asset_vulnerability` datastream support for the Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) vulnerability workflow.
        This will require a transform node, the necessary permissions to use the transform, and specified source and destination indices.
        It also stores the latest copy of vulnerabilities in the destination indices, which will require additional storage.
