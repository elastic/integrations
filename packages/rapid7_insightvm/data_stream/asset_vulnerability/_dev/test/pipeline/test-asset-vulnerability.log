Each\n          call to the mailslot write function results in a two byte return value\n          being written into the response packet. The code which creates this packet\n          fails to consider these two bytes in the allocation routine, resulting in\n          a slow corruption of the kernel memory pool. These two bytes are almost\n          always set to \"\\xff\\xff\" (a short integer with value of -1).","id":"auxiliary/dos/windows/smb/ms06_035_mailslot","name":"Microsoft SRV.SYS Mailslot Write Corruption","rank":"normal","skill_level":"intermediate","source":"metasploit"}],"first_found":"2018-11-25T08:24:37Z","id":"windows-hotfix-ms06-035","key":"","last_found":"2023-06-23T19:39:41.339Z","links":[{"href":"http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/189140","id":"189140","source":"cert-vn"},{"href":"https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26818","id":"win-mailslot-bo(26818)","source":"xf"},{"href":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18863","id":"18863","source":"bid"},{"href":"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/917159","id":"KB917159","source":"mskb"},{"href":"http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA06-192A.html","id":"TA06-192A","source":"cert"},{"href":"http://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-1314","id":"CVE-2006-1314","source":"cve"},{"href":"http://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-1315","id":"CVE-2006-1315","source":"cve"},{"href":"https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval:org.mitre.oval:def:3","id":"3","source":"oval"},{"href":"https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval:org.mitre.oval:def:600","id":"600","source":"oval"},{"href":"http://www.osvdb.org/27155","id":"27155","source":"osvdb"},{"href":"http://www.osvdb.org/27154","id":"27154","source":"osvdb"},{"href":"http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/MS06-035","id":"MS06-035","source":"ms"},{"href":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18891","id":"18891","source":"bid"},{"href":"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS06-035","id":"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS06-035","source":"url"},{"href":"https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26820","id":"win-smb-information-disclosure(26820)","source":"xf"},{"href":"http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/333636","id":"333636","source":"cert-vn"}],"malware_kits":[],"modified":"2025-02-18T00:00:00Z","nic":null,"pci_cvss_score":7.5,"pci_fail":true,"pci_severity_score":5,"pci_special_notes":"","pci_status":"fail","port":null,"proof":"<p><p>Vulnerable OS: Microsoft Windows XP<p></p></p><p>Server responded with vulnerable error code: 2 and class: 1</p></p>","protocol":null,"published":"2006-07-11T00:00:00Z","references":"bid:18863,bid:18891,cert-vn:189140,osvdb:27154,osvdb:27155,oval:3,cert-vn:333636,oval:600,cve:CVE-2006-1314,cve:CVE-2006-1315,mskb:KB917159,ms:MS06-035,cert:TA06-192A,url:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS06-035,xf:win-mailslot-bo(26818),xf:win-smb-information-disclosure(26820)","reintroduced":null,"risk_score":756.61,"severity":"critical","severity_score":8,"solution_fix":"Take a look at all possible solutions for vulnerability","solution_id":"unknown-windows-hotfix-ms06-035","solution_summary":"The solution is unknown for vuln windows-hotfix-ms06-035","solution_type":"workaround","status":"VULNERABLE_EXPL","title":"MS06-035: Vulnerability in Server Service Could Allow Remote Code Execution (917159)","vulnerability_id":"windows-hotfix-ms06-035"}}
