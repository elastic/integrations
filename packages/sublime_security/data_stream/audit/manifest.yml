          If the SQS queue will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldnâ€™t process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded. This is a list of selectors which are made up of regex and expand_event_list_from_field options. The regex should match the S3 object key in the SQS message, and the optional expand_event_list_from_field is the same as the global setting. If file_selectors is given, then any global expand_event_list_from_field value is ignored in favor of the ones specified in the file_selectors. Regexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that do not match one of the regexes will not be processed.
