# Barracuda integration

This integration is for Barracuda device's logs. It includes the following
datasets for receiving logs over syslog or read from a file:

- `waf` dataset: supports Barracuda Web Application Firewall logs.

Use the Barracuda WAF data stream to ingest log data. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference `data_stream.dataset:barracuda.waf` when troubleshooting an issue.

## Upgrade

The Technical preview `spamfirewall` data stream has been deprecated and removed, as of v1.0 of this integration. As we work on a replacement for the Spam Firewall integration, you can continue to use the [Spam Firewall filebeat module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-barracuda.html).

## WAF

Barracuda Web Application Firewall protects applications, APIs, and mobile app backends against a variety of attacks including the OWASP Top 10, zero-day threats, data leakage, and application-layer denial of service (DoS) attacks. By combining signature-based policies and positive security with robust anomaly-detection capabilities, Barracuda Web Application Firewall can defeat todayâ€™s most sophisticated attacks targeting your web applications.

### Requirements

This integration is built and tested against the Barracuda Web Application Firewall version **12.1**. Earlier versions may work, but have not been tested.

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

### Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

### WAF Events

The `barracuda.waf` dataset provides events from the configured syslog server. All Barracuda WAF syslog specific fields are available in the `barracuda.waf` field group.

An example event for `waf` looks as following:
