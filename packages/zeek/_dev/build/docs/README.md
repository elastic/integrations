# Zeek Integration for Elastic

> **Note**: This documentation was generated using AI and should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Overview

The Zeek integration for Elastic enables you to collect and analyze high-fidelity network security monitoring logs generated by Zeek's passive traffic analysis. This integration transforms raw network metadata into actionable insights within the Elastic Stack, allowing you to monitor network activity, detect threats, and investigate security incidents.

This integration facilitates:
- Threat hunting: You can search and analyze detailed connection logs, file hashes, and protocol-specific data to proactively hunt for threats.
- Incident response: You'll accelerate investigations with rich, contextual network data to understand the scope and impact of security events.
- Security monitoring: You use pre-built Kibana dashboards to monitor network traffic for anomalies, policy violations, and known attack patterns.
- Network visibility: You gain deep insights into network activity, including encrypted traffic using SSL/TLS metadata, DNS requests, and file transfers.

### Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Zeek version 2.6.1, which was the primary version used during development. However, it's expected to work with all later versions, including the latest LTS releases.

For the integration to parse data correctly, you must configure Zeek with the `json-logs` policy.

### How it works

This integration works by collecting logs that Zeek generates after performing passive network traffic analysis. Zeek produces various log files—such as `conn.log`, `dns.log`, and `http.log`—which contain detailed metadata about the network traffic it observes. You deploy an Elastic Agent on the host where Zeek is running or where its logs are stored. The agent is configured to read these JSON-formatted log files from the Zeek log directory and forward the data to your Elastic deployment, where it's normalized into the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for analysis.

## What data does this integration collect?

The Zeek integration collects a comprehensive range of network metadata by ingesting log files generated by the Zeek network security monitor. Each data stream corresponds to a specific Zeek log file and provides detailed insights into various network protocols and system activities.

The Zeek integration collects log messages of the following types:
*   `capture_loss`: Monitor packet loss at the sensor level to ensure data integrity.
*   `connection`: Metadata for TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections, including source and destination information, duration, and bytes transferred.

### Supported use cases

Integrating Zeek logs with Elastic provides you with a powerful solution for enhancing network visibility and security posture. You can use this integration to support the following use cases:
*   Real-time threat detection: You can use Elastic Security to alert on suspicious network patterns, such as data exfiltration using DNS or unauthorized SSH connections.
*   Incident response and forensics: You'll have access to a rich repository of protocol-specific metadata to investigate the scope and timeline of a security breach.
*   Network performance monitoring: You can analyze `capture_loss` and `stats` data to ensure your network monitoring infrastructure is operating efficiently.
*   Compliance and auditing: You can maintain long-term, searchable archives of network transactions, including file transfers and authentication events, to meet regulatory requirements.
*   Asset discovery: You can use `known_hosts`, `known_services`, and `software` data to automatically discover and inventory the devices and applications on your network.

## What do I need to use this integration?

Before you install the integration, you'll need to ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

### Elastic prerequisites

You'll need to set up the following Elastic components:
- You must install the Elastic Agent on the host where the Zeek logs are located and enroll it in Fleet.
- You'll need a stable network connection between the Elastic Agent and the Elastic Stack (`Elasticsearch` and `Kibana`) to ship data and receive policy updates.
- You must ensure the user account running the Elastic Agent has read permissions for the Zeek log directory, typically `/opt/zeek/logs/current`.

### Vendor prerequisites

Your Zeek environment must meet these conditions:
- The Elastic Agent must have read access to the directory where Zeek writes its logs, such as `/opt/zeek/logs/current`.

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed on the host where Zeek is running or where its logs are stored. For detailed installation instructions, refer to the Elastic Agent [installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the log files and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed using the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Set up steps in Zeek

Before you can collect data, you must configure your Zeek instance to output logs in JSON format. This integration relies on JSON-formatted logs for accurate parsing and ingestion.

Follow these steps to enable JSON logging:

1.  Locate the site configuration file. Identify the `local.zeek` file for your site-specific configuration. Common paths include:
    *   `/opt/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek` (standard package install)
    *   `/usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek` (source install)
2.  Edit the configuration. Open the file with root privileges using a text editor.
3.  Enable JSON logging. Append the following line to the end of the file to force all log streams into JSON format:
    ```zeek
    @load policy/tuning/json-logs.zeek
    ```
4.  Save and exit. Save the changes to the file.
5.  Check the configuration. Use the Zeek control utility to verify that the scripts load correctly:
    ```bash
    sudo zeekctl check
    ```
6.  Apply and restart. Deploy the new configuration and restart the Zeek processes:
    ```bash
    sudo zeekctl deploy
    ```
7.  Verify JSON format. Check one of the current logs to ensure it's formatted as JSON. The output should start with a `{` character. For example:
    ```bash
    head -n 1 /opt/zeek/logs/current/conn.log
    ```

    *   **Tags**: Add custom tags to your events for easier filtering (e.g., `['forwarded', 'zeek-sensor-1']`).
    *   **Processors**: Add Elastic Agent processors to filter or enhance data before ingestion.
8.  Click **Save and continue** or **Add Integration**.

### Validation

Follow these steps to verify that the integration is working correctly and data is flowing into Elasticsearch:

1.  In Kibana, navigate to **Fleet > Agents** and verify that the Elastic Agent is online and has a healthy status.
2.  Generate network traffic or activity on the host monitored by Zeek to trigger log generation.
3.  Navigate to **Discover**.
4.  Select the `logs-*` data view.
5.  Filter the results using a KQL query such as `data_stream.dataset : "zeek.connection"`.
6.  Verify that events are appearing with recent timestamps.
7.  Check that protocol-specific fields are populated correctly (for example, `source.ip`, `destination.ip`, `zeek.connection.id`).
8.  Navigate to **Dashboards** and search for "Zeek" to view the pre-built dashboards, such as the Network Traffic or Protocol Overview dashboards, and confirm they are populated with data.

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).

### Common configuration issues

You can resolve most issues by checking the following common configuration points:

- Logs are not visible in Kibana: Verify that Zeek is actively monitoring traffic and writing logs to the expected location. Check that the `Base Path` in the integration settings correctly points to your Zeek log directory, such as `/opt/zeek/logs/current/` or `/var/log/bro/current/`.
- Zeek logs are not in JSON format: This integration requires logs to be in JSON format. If your logs are tab-separated, ensure you have added `@load policy/tuning/json-logs.zeek` to your `local.zeek` configuration file and applied the changes by running `sudo zeekctl deploy`.
- Permission denied: The user account running the Elastic Agent must have read permissions for the Zeek log directory. Check directory permissions with `ls -ld /opt/zeek/logs/current/` to ensure the agent can access the files.
- Incomplete data collection: If only some logs are appearing, check the specific filename settings for each data stream in the integration configuration. If you have customized your Zeek configuration to use non-standard filenames, you must update the corresponding data stream settings to match the actual files, such as `conn.log` or `http.log`.
- Data parsing errors: If you use custom Zeek scripts that modify standard log fields, the ingest pipeline may fail to parse the data correctly. Verify that your `local.zeek` configuration does not conflict with standard JSON output schemas.
- Zeek service state: Ensure that Zeek is running and that the `current` directory is being updated. You can check the status of your Zeek nodes using the `sudo zeekctl status` command.

## Performance and scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

In a high-volume environment, you may need to scale your `Zeek` deployment into a cluster. In this scenario, you can aggregate logs on a dedicated log collector host where the `Elastic Agent` is installed. This setup provides the following benefits:
- Centralizes log collection to a single point for easier management.
- Reduces the processing and resource load on your individual `Zeek` workers.
