# Zeek Integration

This is an integration for Zeek, which used to be called Bro. It
parses logs that are in the [Zeek JSON
format](https://www.zeek.org/manual/release/logs/index.html).

## Compatibility
This module has been developed against Zeek 2.6.1, but is expected to
work with other versions of Zeek.

Zeek requires a Unix-like platform, and it currently supports Linux,
FreeBSD, and Mac OS X.  Find out how to use Zeek here:

## Logs
### capture_loss

The `capture_loss` dataset collects the Zeek capture_loss.log file,
which contains packet loss rate data.
