# Platform Observability

## Compatibility

This package works with Kibana 8.3.0 and later.

## Kibana logs

The Kibana integration collects logs from [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html) instance.

### Logs

#### Audit

Configure `Path` pointing to the location where audit logs will be created, based on the [Kibana Audit logging settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/security-settings-kb.html#audit-logging-settings) in `kibana.yml`

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| kibana.add_to_spaces | The set of space ids that a saved object was shared to. | keyword |
| kibana.authentication_provider | The authentication provider associated with a login event. | keyword |
| kibana.authentication_realm | The Elasticsearch authentication realm name which fulfilled a login event. | keyword |
| kibana.authentication_type | The authentication provider type associated with a login event. | keyword |
| kibana.delete_from_spaces | The set of space ids that a saved object was removed from. | keyword |
| kibana.lookup_realm | The Elasticsearch lookup realm which fulfilled a login event. | keyword |
| kibana.saved_object.id | The id of the saved object associated with this event. | keyword |
| kibana.saved_object.type | The type of the saved object associated with this event. | keyword |
| kibana.session_id | The ID of the user session associated with this event. Each login attempt results in a unique session id. | keyword |
| kibana.space_id | The id of the space associated with this event. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.logger | The name of the logger inside an application. This is usually the name of the class which initialized the logger, or can be a custom name. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| process.pid | Process id. | long |
| trace.id | Unique identifier of the trace. A trace groups multiple events like transactions that belong together. For example, a user request handled by multiple inter-connected services. | keyword |
| transaction.id | Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace. A transaction is the highest level of work measured within a service, such as a request to a server. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |
| user.roles | Array of user roles at the time of the event. | keyword |

| http.request.id | A unique identifier for each HTTP request to correlate logs between clients and servers in transactions. The id may be contained in a non-standard HTTP header, such as `X-Request-ID` or `X-Correlation-ID`. | keyword |
