          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the events are shipped. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html) for details.

          Additional settings to be added to the configuration.

          Example:

              condition: ${kubernetes.labels.app} == 'ingress-nginx'

          Explanation:

              Now you can use http://${kubernetes.pod.ip} in hosts

          ATTENTION!
          Be careful using this as it might break the input as those settings are not validated and can override the settings specified above.
