# OpenTelemetry Package

Exploratory package to post-process opentelemetry data from apm-server. Neither it is for end-user consumption, nor is it a representative otel integration. For internal research & review purprose only.

Processes opentelemetry documents generated by [apm-server](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/open-telemetry.html) using opentelemetry [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for [hostmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver/README.md).

## Assumptions
* opentelemetry-collector to provide *service.name* as dummy. The dataset binding is based on it.
* Uses a dummy data stream for now, which just pings(localhost:9200") as a redundant step.
* Uses hostmetrics system.filesystem mappings in ingest pipeline mapping.

## Datastream
* datastream: metrics-apm.app.dummy-default
* dataset: apm.app.dummy

## Dummy data stream
This is a dummy data-stream for illustrative purpose only.
