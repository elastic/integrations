# Sysdig Integration
This integration allows for the shipping of [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) logs to Elastic for security, observability and organizational awareness. Logs can then be analyzed by using either the dashboard included with the integration or via the creation of custom dashboards within Kibana.

## Data Streams
The Sysdig integration collects four types of logs:

**Alerts** The Alerts data stream collected by the Sysdig integration is comprised of Sysdig Alerts. See more details about Sysdig Alerts in [Sysdig's Alerts Documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-monitor/alerts/). A complete list of potential fields used by this integration can be found in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference)

**Event** The event data stream collected through the Sysdig integration consists of Sysdig Security Events. See more details about Security Events in [Sysdig's Events Feed Documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/threats/activity/events-feed/). It uses Sysdig's Next Gen API (standardized). You can access your regional documentation through the links [here](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/developer-tools/sysdig-api/#access-next-gen-api-documentation-using-regional-endpoints).

**CSPM** The CSPM data stream collected through the Sysdig integration consists of Sysdig compliance results. See more details about compliance results in [Sysdig's Compliance documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/compliance/). It uses Sysdig's Current API (non-standardised). You can access your regional documentation through the links [here](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/developer-tools/sysdig-api/#access-current-api-documentation-using-regional-endpoints).

**Vulnerability** The vulnerability data stream collected through the Sysdig integration consists of Sysdig vulnerability scan results. See more details about vulnerabilities in [Sysdig's Vulnerability Management documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/vulnerability-management/). It uses Sysdig's Next Gen API (standardized). You can access your regional documentation through the links [here](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/developer-tools/sysdig-api/#access-next-gen-api-documentation-using-regional-endpoints).

For vulnerability data, Each interval fetches all available scan results from the configured stage. Currently, only one stage can be configured at a time. Users wishing to collect scan results from different stages must configure additional integrations for each desired stage.

Scan results are broken down into separate events for each package-vulnerability pair. If no vulnerability is found for a package, then only the package details will be included in the published event. If the scans contain no package information, then only the scan details will be included in the published event.

In detail, a package is included in one layer, which can be built upon several base images. Furthermore, a package can have multiple vulnerabilities, each of which can have multiple risk accepts.

## Requirements

### Agent-based installation

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md).

Sysdig must be configured to output alerts to a supported output channel as defined in [Setup](#setup). The system will only receive common fields output by Sysdig's rules, meaning that if a rule does not include a desired field the rule must be edited in Sysdig to add the field.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the [Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/starting-with-the-elasticsearch-platform-and-its-solutions/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

In order to capture alerts from Sysdig you **must** configure Sysdig to output Alerts as JSON via [HTTP](#http-input).

### HTTP Input

The HTTP input allows the Elastic Agent to receive Sysdig Alerts via HTTP webhook.

**Required:** To configure Sysdig to output JSON, you must set up as webhook notification channel as outlined in the [Sysdig Documentation](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/administration-settings/outbound-integrations/notifications-management/set-up-notification-channels/configure-a-webhook-channel/).

### To collect data from the Sysdig API:

- Retrieve the API Token by following the [Sysdig API Token Guide](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/retrieve-the-sysdig-api-token).
- The API URL varies by region. To determine the correct URL for your region, use the following guides:
  - For Sysdig's Next Gen API, refer to the [regional endpoints guide](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/developer-tools/sysdig-api/#access-the-sysdig-api-using-the-regional-endpoints).
  - For Sysdig's Current API, refer to the [SaaS regions and IP ranges guide](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/administration/saas-regions-and-ip-ranges/#overview).

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana navigate to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" top bar, search for `Sysdig`.
3. Select the "Sysdig" integration from the search results.
4. Select "Add Sysdig" to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters, including the URL, API Token, Interval, and Initial Interval, to enable data collection.
6. Select "Save and continue" to save the integration.

**Note**:
  - If you see an error saying `exceeded maximum number of CEL executions` during data ingestion, it usually means a large volume of data is being processed for the selected time interval. To fix this, try increasing the `Maximum Pages Per Interval` setting in the configuration.
  - Users wishing to collect vulnerability scan results from multiple stages must configure individual integrations for each desired stage.
