## Setup

To use this package you need to enable datastreams you want to collect metrics for and register an application in [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id).

Once the application is registered, configure and/or note the following to setup O365 metrics Elastic integration:
1. Note `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID` in the registered application's `Overview` page.
2. Create a new secret to configure the authentication of your application. 
    - Navigate to `Certificates & Secrets` section.
    - Click `New client secret` and provide some description to create new secret.
    - Note the `Value` which is required for the integration setup.
3. Add permissions to your registered application. Please check [O365 Graph API permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/reportroot-authorization) for more details.
    - Navigate to `API permissions` page and click `Add a permission`
    - Select `Office 365 Management APIs` tile from the listed tiles.
    - Click `Application permissions`.
    - If `User.Read` and `Reports.Read.All` permission under `Microsoft.Graph` tile is not added by default, add this permission.
    - After the permissions are added, the admin has to grant consent for these permissions.

Once the secret is created and permissions are granted by admin, setup Elastic Agent's Microsoft O365 integration:
- Click `Add Microsoft Office 365`.
- Enable `Collect Office 365 metrics via Graph API using CEL Input`.
- Add `Directory (tenant) ID` noted in Step 1 into `Directory (tenant) ID` parameter. This is required field.
- Add `Application (client) ID` noted in Step 1 into `Application (client) ID` parameter. This is required field.
- Add the secret `Value` noted in Step 2 into `Client Secret` parameter. This is required field.
- Oauth2 Token URL can be added to generate the tokens during the oauth2 flow. If not provided, above `Directory (tenant) ID` will be used for oauth2 token generation.
- Modify any other parameters as necessary.

### Period-based vs Day-based data-streams

Some data-streams listed earlier ingest data aggregated by a `period`, while other data-streams ingest data aggregated by `day` i.e., aggregated daily.

- When configuring `Period-based` data-streams, the configuration option `Period` must be used during setup. The supported values are: D7, D30, D90, and D180.
- As `Day-based` data-streams ingest aggregated data per day, the configuration option `Initial Interval` must be set which indicates how far back (in number of days) to fetch the data. Values between 1-28 are allowed.

### Additional Information on Day-based data-streams

Microsoft 365 reports are typically available within [48 hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide), but may sometimes take several days. As per their [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft-teams-user-activity-preview?view=o365-worldwide#interpret-the-microsoft-teams-user-activity-report), data quality is ensured by performing daily validation checks to fill any gaps in data. During this process, users may notice differences in historical data in Microsoft 365 Reports in admin center.

To ensure these filled gaps and historical data-accuracy is also ingested into Elastic, the Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration enables you to adjust `Sync Days in the past` parameter for `Day-based` data-streams. You can use this parameter to re-fetch the Microsoft 365 reports starting from *N* days in the past. Default value for this paramater is `3`. You can gradually increase this value if you see any discrepancies between Microsoft Reports and Elastic data (maximum value allowed is `28`).

Due to this re-fetching of data on same dates and the way Elastic data-streams work in [append-only](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html) design, the ingested data may have duplicates. For example, you may see duplicate documents in Elastic on the source data-stream backed indices per resource (user/group/site) per report date. To maintain only the latest copy of document, the Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration installs [Latest Transforms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transform-overview.html#latest-transform-overview), one per report. These latest transform periodically pulls the data from source data-stream backed indices into a destination non-data-stream backed index. Hence the destination indices only contains single (latest) document per resource (user/group/site) per report date. Inside the reports dataset, you can distinguish between source and destination indices using the field `labels.is_transform_source`. This is set to `true` for source data-stream backed indices and `false` for destination (latest) indices.

Thus when searching for data, you should use a filter `labels.is_transform_source: false` to avoid seeing any duplicates. The Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration dashboards also has this filter to only show the latest datapoints.

As the latest data is available in destination indices, the source data-stream backed indices are purged based on ILM policy `metrics-o365_metrics.<data_stream>-default_policy`.

| o365.metrics.report.name          | Source filter | Source indices | Destination filter | Destination indices | Destination alias |
|------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Microsoft 365 Groups Activity Group Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail_latest` |
| OneDrive Usage Account Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail_latest` |
| Teams User Activity User Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail_latest` |
| Viva Engage Groups Activity Group Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail_latest` |

**Note:** `Sync Days in the past` and `Latest Transforms` are only used in `Day`-based data-streams, i.e., for data-streams aggregated per day.

### Data Anonymization

By default for all Microsoft 365 usage reports, the user names, emails, group, or site information are anonymized by Microsoft using MD5 hashes. You can revert this change for a tenant and show identifiable user, group, and site information if your organization's privacy practices allow it. To do this, follow below steps:
1. Login to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
2. Navigate to `Settings` --> `Org Settings` --> `Services` page.
3. Select `Reports`
4. Uncheck the statement `Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports`, and then save your changes.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`.

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |
| labels.is_transform_source | Distinguishes between documents that are a source for a transform and documents that are an output of a transform, to facilitate easier filtering. | constant_keyword |  |

Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |
| labels.is_transform_source | Distinguishes between documents that are a source for a transform and documents that are an output of a transform, to facilitate easier filtering. | constant_keyword |  |
| o365.metrics.report.api_path | Microsoft Graph API path used to pull the report. | keyword |  |
| o365.metrics.report.name | Name of the report. | keyword |  |
| o365.metrics.viva_engage.groups.activity.group.detail.group_display_name | The name of the group. | keyword |  |
| o365.metrics.viva_engage.groups.activity.group.detail.group_type | The type of group, public or private. | keyword |  |
| o365.metrics.viva_engage.groups.activity.group.detail.is_deleted | If the group is deleted, but had activity in the reporting period it will show up in the grid with this flag set to true. | boolean |  |
| o365.metrics.viva_engage.groups.activity.group.detail.last_activity_date | The latest date a message was read, posted or liked by the group. | date |  |
| o365.metrics.viva_engage.groups.activity.group.detail.liked.count | The number of messages liked in the Viva Engage group over the reporting period. | long |  |
