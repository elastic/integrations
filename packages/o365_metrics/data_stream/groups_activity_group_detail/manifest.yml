        description: >
          Specifies the number of days in the past to sync per request. As Microsoft reports are not real-time, and can take upto 48h or more to be available, this value allows to fetch the data from *N* days in the past. This re-fetching of data helps in filling any gaps between Elastic and Microsoft reports. Only values between 1-27 are allowed.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the data is parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html) for detail.

          The request tracer logs HTTP requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging.
