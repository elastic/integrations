# Microsoft Office 365 Metrics Integration

This integration uses the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) to collect essential metrics from Microsoft Office 365, offering detailed insights into user activity, application usage, and overall system performance.

## Data streams

Following Microsoft 365 Graph Reports can be collected by Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration.

## Setup

To use this package you need to enable datastreams you want to collect metrics for and register an application in [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id).

Once the application is registered, configure and/or note the following to setup O365 metrics Elastic integration:
1. Note `Application (client) ID` and the `Directory (tenant) ID` in the registered application's `Overview` page.
2. Create a new secret to configure the authentication of your application. 
    - Navigate to `Certificates & Secrets` section.
    - Click `New client secret` and provide some description to create new secret.
    - Note the `Value` which is required for the integration setup.
3. Add permissions to your registered application.
    - Select and add the appropriate permissions from the available tiles.
    - For this package, we primarily use Graph APIs, so you can choose `Microsoft Graph`, which will display the Delegated and Application permission sections.
    - Refer to the `Required Permissions` column in the table under [Data streams](#data-streams) section to identify the permissions required for each data stream and select accordingly. You can also refer to the Permissions section in the API documentation for each data stream to determine the necessary permissions.
    - Ensure Reports.Read.All from Microsoft Graph is added, as most APIs are report-based.
    - After the permissions are added, the admin will need to grant consent for a few permissions.

Once the secret is created and permissions are granted by admin, setup Elastic Agent's Microsoft O365 integration:
- Click `Add Microsoft Office 365`.
- Enable `Collect Office 365 metrics via Graph API using CEL Input`.
- Add `Directory (tenant) ID` noted in Step 1 into `Directory (tenant) ID` parameter. This is required field.
- Add `Application (client) ID` noted in Step 1 into `Application (client) ID` parameter. This is required field.
- Add the secret `Value` noted in Step 2 into `Client Secret` parameter. This is required field.
- Oauth2 Token URL can be added to generate the tokens during the oauth2 flow. If not provided, above `Directory (tenant) ID` will be used for oauth2 token generation.
- Modify any other parameters as necessary.

### Period-based vs Day-based data-streams

Some data-streams listed earlier ingest data aggregated by a `period`, while other data-streams ingest data aggregated by `day` i.e., aggregated daily.

- When configuring `Period-based` data-streams, the configuration option `Period` must be used during setup. The supported values are: D7, D30, D90, and D180.
- As `Day-based` data-streams ingest aggregated data per day, the configuration option `Initial Interval` must be set which indicates how far back (in number of days) to fetch the data. Values between 1-28 are allowed.

### Additional Information on Day-based data-streams

Microsoft 365 reports are typically available within [48 hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide), but may sometimes take several days. As per their [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft-teams-user-activity-preview?view=o365-worldwide#interpret-the-microsoft-teams-user-activity-report), data quality is ensured by performing daily validation checks to fill any gaps in data. During this process, users may notice differences in historical data in Microsoft 365 Reports in admin center.

To ensure these filled gaps and historical data-accuracy is also ingested into Elastic, the Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration enables you to adjust `Sync Days in the past` parameter for `Day-based` data-streams. You can use this parameter to re-fetch the Microsoft 365 reports starting from *N* days in the past. Default value for this paramater is `3`. You can gradually increase this value if you see any discrepancies between Microsoft Reports and Elastic data (maximum value allowed is `28`).

Due to this re-fetching of data on same dates and the way Elastic data-streams work in [append-only](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html) design, the ingested data may have duplicates. For example, you may see duplicate documents in Elastic on the source data-stream backed indices per resource (user/group/site) per report date. To maintain only the latest copy of document, the Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration installs [Latest Transforms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transform-overview.html#latest-transform-overview), one per report. These latest transform periodically pulls the data from source data-stream backed indices into a destination non-data-stream backed index. Hence the destination indices only contains single (latest) document per resource (user/group/site) per report date. Inside the reports dataset, you can distinguish between source and destination indices using the field `labels.is_transform_source`. This is set to `true` for source data-stream backed indices and `false` for destination (latest) indices.

Thus when searching for data, you should use a filter `labels.is_transform_source: false` to avoid seeing any duplicates. The Microsoft Office 365 Metrics integration dashboards also has this filter to only show the latest datapoints.

As the latest data is available in destination indices, the source data-stream backed indices are purged based on ILM policy `metrics-o365_metrics.<data_stream>-default_policy`.

| o365.metrics.report.name          | Source filter | Source indices | Destination filter | Destination indices | Destination alias |
|------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Microsoft 365 Groups Activity Group Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.groups_activity_group_detail_latest` |
| OneDrive Usage Account Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.onedrive_usage_account_detail_latest` |
| Teams User Activity User Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.teams_user_activity_user_detail_latest` |
| Viva Engage Groups Activity Group Detail  |  `labels.is_transform_source: true`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail-*` |  `labels.is_transform_source: false`  | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail_latest-*` | `metrics-o365_metrics.viva_engage_groups_activity_group_detail_latest` |

**Note:** `Sync Days in the past` and `Latest Transforms` are only used in `Day`-based data-streams, i.e., for data-streams aggregated per day.

### Data Anonymization

By default for all Microsoft 365 usage reports, the user names, emails, group, or site information are anonymized by Microsoft using MD5 hashes. You can revert this change for a tenant and show identifiable user, group, and site information if your organization's privacy practices allow it. To do this, follow below steps:
1. Login to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
2. Navigate to `Settings` --> `Org Settings` --> `Services` page.
3. Select `Reports`
4. Uncheck the statement `Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports`, and then save your changes.
