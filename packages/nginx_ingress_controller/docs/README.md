# Nginx Ingress Controller Integration

This integration periodically fetches logs from [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
instances. It can parse access and error logs created by the ingress.

## Compatibility

The integration was tested with the Nginx Ingress Controller v0.30.0 and v0.40.2. The log format is described
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/nginx-0.30.0/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/log-format.md).

## Logs

### Access Logs

The `access` data stream collects the Nginx Ingress Controller access logs.

An example event for `access` looks as following:
