# Nginx Ingress Controller Integration

This integration periodically fetches logs from [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
instances. It can parse access and error logs created by the ingress.

## Compatibility

The integration was tested with the Nginx Ingress Controller v0.30.0 and v0.40.2. The log format is described
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/nginx-0.30.0/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/log-format.md).

## Logs

### Access Logs

The `access` data stream collects the Nginx Ingress Controller access logs.

An example event for `access` looks as following:

| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |

| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| nginx_ingress_controller.access.http.request.id | The randomly generated ID of the request | text |
| nginx_ingress_controller.access.http.request.length | The request length (including request line, header, and request body) | long |
| nginx_ingress_controller.access.http.request.time | Time elapsed since the first bytes were read from the client | double |
| nginx_ingress_controller.access.remote_ip_list | An array of remote IP addresses. It is a list because it is common to include, besides the client IP address, IP addresses from headers like `X-Forwarded-For`. Real source IP is restored to `source.ip`. | array |

| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |

In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.full.text | Multi-field of `url.full`. | match_only_text |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |

Ingress Controller is built around the Kubernetes Ingress resource, using a ConfigMap to store the NGINX configuration. Hence a k8s cluster is required before having
Ingress Controller up and runnning. Docs: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/

0. [Setup a k8s cluster](k8s.md).
1. Setup ingress controller following https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/
2. Redirect pods' logs to a temporary file: `kubectl -n kube-system logs -f nginx-ingress-controller-6fc5bcc8c9-zm8zv >> /tmp/ingresspod`
3. Configure Beats module:
```
- module: nginx
  # Ingress-nginx controller logs. This is disabled by default. It could be used in Kubernetes environments to parse ingress-nginx logs
  ingress_controller:
    enabled: true

    # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
    # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
    var.paths: ["/tmp/ingresspod"]
```
4. Setup pipelines and dashboards in ES
5. Start Filebeat
6. Produce traffic:
```
# visit `http://hello-world.info/v2` and `http://hello-world.info` from different browser engines
# use curl and wget to access the pages with different http words ie: curl -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" -X GET hello-world.info 
```


## Detailed example with kind

0. Use the `Quick start` guide under https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/ and then local testing example

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.3.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

kubectl create deployment demo --image=httpd --port=80
kubectl expose deployment demo

kubectl create ingress demo-localhost --class=nginx \
  --rule="demo.localdev.me/*=demo:80"

kubectl port-forward --namespace=ingress-nginx service/ingress-nginx-controller 8080:80
```

`Produce Traffic by visiting: http://demo.localdev.me:8080/`

> `demo.localdev.me` is DNS defaulting to localhost reserved by AWS


If you want to configure ingress-nginx to output to json format use the following  configuration in the `ingress-nginx-controller`

0. Download manifest
  ```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.3.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

1. Edit deploy.yaml
  ```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  allow-snippet-annotations: "true"
  log-format-escape-json: "true"
  log-format-upstream: '{"timestamp": "$time_iso8601", "requestID": "$req_id", "proxyUpstreamName":
    "$proxy_upstream_name", "proxyAlternativeUpstreamName": "$proxy_alternative_upstream_name","upstreamStatus":
    "$upstream_status", "upstreamAddr": "$upstream_addr","httpRequest":{"requestMethod":
    "$request_method", "requestUrl": "$host$request_uri", "status": $status,"requestSize":
    "$request_length", "responseSize": "$upstream_response_length", "userAgent": "$http_user_agent",
    "remoteIp": "$remote_addr", "referer": "$http_referer", "latency": "$upstream_response_time s",
    "protocol":"$server_protocol"}}'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.3.1
  name: ingress-nginx-controller
  namespace: ingress-nginx
```

2. Re apply manifest:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

3. Inspect logs
  ```bash
   kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller-7bf78659d-2th2m -f
