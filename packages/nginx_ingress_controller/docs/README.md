# Nginx Ingress Controller Integration

This integration periodically fetches logs from [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
instances. It can parse access and error logs created by the ingress.

## Compatibility

The integration was tested with the Nginx Ingress Controller v0.30.0 and v0.40.2. The log format is described
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/nginx-0.30.0/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/log-format.md).

## Logs

### Access Logs

The `access` data stream collects the Nginx Ingress Controller access logs.

An example event for `access` looks as following:

```json
{
    "nginx_ingress_controller": {
        "access": {
            "http": {
                "request": {

                },
                "ip": "172.17.0.5"
            }
        }
    },
    "@timestamp": "2020-02-07T11:48:51.000Z",
    "related": {
        "ip": [

    },
    "event": {
        "category": [
            "web"
        ],
        "type": [
            "info"
        ],
        "created": "2020-04-28T11:07:58.223Z",
        "kind": "event",
        "outcome": "success"
