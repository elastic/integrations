# Nginx Ingress Controller Integration

This integration periodically fetches logs from [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
instances. It can parse access and error logs created by the ingress.

## Compatibility

The integration was tested with the Nginx Ingress Controller v0.30.0 and v0.40.2. The log format is described
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/nginx-0.30.0/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/log-format.md).

## Logs

### Access Logs

The `access` data stream collects the Nginx Ingress Controller access logs.

An example event for `access` looks as following:

| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
