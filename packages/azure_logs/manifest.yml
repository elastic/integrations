          Do not use the event hub namespace here. Elastic
          recommends using one event hub for each integration.
          Visit [Create an event hub](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure#create-an-event-hub)
          to learn more. Use event hub names up to 30 characters long
          to avoid compatibility issues.
