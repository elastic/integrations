          Do not use the event hub namespace here. Elastic

          Visit [Create an event hub](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure#create-an-event-hub)
          to learn more. Use event hub names up to 30 characters long
          to avoid compatibility issues.

          (default option), you MUST use a dedicated storage account container for each event hub / consumer group pair.
          For information about container name restrictions, please refer to the
          [Container Names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names)
          section in Microsoft's documentation.
          If you don't specify a container name, the integration will automatically generate a default one for you.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported
          event or to enhance the event with metadata. This runs in the agent
          before the logs are parsed.
          Check [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html)

          The processor version that the integration should use.
          Possible values are `v1` and `v2` (preview). 
          
          The v2 event hub processor is in preview, so using the v1 processor
          is recommended for typical use cases.
          
          Default is `v1`.

          (Processor v2 only) How often the processor should attempt to claim
          partitions.
          
          Default is `10` seconds.

        description: >-
          (Processor v2 only) Controls from what position in the event hub
          the processor should start processing messages for all partitions.
          
          Possible values are `earliest` and `latest`.
          
          `earliest` starts processing messages from the last checkpoint, or the
          beginning of the event hub if no checkpoint is available.

          `latest` starts processing messages from the the latest event in the
          event hub and continues to process new events as they arrive.
          
          Default is `earliest`.

          (Processor v2 only) Flag to control if the processor should perform 
          the checkpoint information migration from processor v1 to v2
          at startup.
          
          The checkpoint migration converts the checkpoint information
          from the v1 format to the v2 format.

          Default is `false`, which means the processor will not perform the
          checkpoint migration.

          (Processor v2 only) Maximum time to wait before processing the
          messages received from the event hub.
          
          The partition consumer waits up to a "receive count" or a
          "receive timeout", whichever comes first.

          Default is `5` seconds.

          "receive timeout", whichever comes first.

          Default is `100` messages.
