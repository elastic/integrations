# Wiz

This [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/) integration enables your security team to continuously prioritize critical risks based on a deep cloud analysis across misconfigurations, network exposure, secrets, vulnerabilities, malware, sensitive data and identities to build a single prioritized risk view for your cloud.

Use the Wiz integration to collect and parse data from Wiz api.

## Data streams

The Wiz integration collects three types of data: Audit, Issue and Vulnerability.

[**Audit**](https://integrate.wiz.io/reference/audit-log) returns a set of Audit Log activities.

[**Issue**](https://integrate.wiz.io/reference/issues-query) returns a set of Issues.

[**Vulnerability**](https://integrate.wiz.io/reference/vulnerability-finding) returns a set of Vulnerability Findings.

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

You have a few options for installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

There are some minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent and for more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

The minimum **kibana.version** required is **8.10.1**.
This module has been tested against the **Wiz API Version v1**.

## Setup

### To collect data from Wiz Graph APIs, You must request the following parameters from your Wiz customer:

1. Client ID
2. Client Secret
3. Token url
4. API Endpoint url
5. Required scopes for each data stream :

    | Data Stream   | Scope         |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | Audit         | admin:audit   |
    | Issue         | read:issues   |
    | Vulnerability | read:vulnerabilities |

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana go to Management > Integrations
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar, type Wiz
3. Click on the "Wiz" integration from the search results.
4. Click on the "Add Wiz" button to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters, such as Client ID, Client Secret, URL, and Token URL. For all data streams, these parameters must be provided in order to retrieve logs.
6. Save the integration.

**Note:**
  - Vulnerability data_stream pulls vulnerabilities from the previous day. For more information, refer to the link [here](https://integrate.wiz.io/reference/vulnerability-finding)
