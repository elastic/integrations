        "description": "A machine learning job has detected a suspicious Windows process. This process has\nbeen classified as malicious in two ways. It was predicted to be malicious by the\nProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be suspicious given that its\nuser context is unusual and does not commonly manifest malicious activity,by an\nunsupervised ML model. Such a process may be an instance of suspicious or malicious\nactivity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using\nconventional search rules.\n",
