        "description": "A machine learning job combination has detected a set of one or more suspicious Windows\nprocesses with unusually high scores for malicious probability. These process(es) have\nbeen classified as malicious in several ways. The process(es) were predicted to be malicious\nby the ProblemChild supervised ML model. If the anomaly contains a cluster of suspicious\nprocesses, each process has the same user name, and the aggregate score of the\nevent cluster was calculated to be unusually high by an unsupervised ML model. Such a cluster\noften contains suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be\nresistant to detection using conventional search rules.\n",
