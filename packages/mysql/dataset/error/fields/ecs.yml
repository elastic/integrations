    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.

      Original log level of the log event.
      If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).
      Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.
