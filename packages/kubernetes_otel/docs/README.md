# Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Assets

Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Assets must be used with OpenTelemetry data. With this package will be installed assets to monitor [Kubernetes clusters](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
