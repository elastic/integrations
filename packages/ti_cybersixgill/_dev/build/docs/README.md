# Cybersixgill Webhook Integration

This integration creates an HTTP listener that accepts incoming HTTP requests from Cybersixgill integration script (provided by Cybersixgill).

The python script provided by Cybersixgill will usually run on the same host or network as the agent installation, polling the Cybersixgill API and forward the data to filebeat over HTTP(s).
