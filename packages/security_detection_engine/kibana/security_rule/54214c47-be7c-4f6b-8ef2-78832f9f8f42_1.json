While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Network Connection to OAST Domain via Script Interpreter\n\nOut-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST) services such as interact.sh, burpcollaborator.net, and similar platforms are designed for security testing to detect vulnerabilities through out-of-band data channels. However, threat actors abuse these same services for data exfiltration, command and control, and DNS-based exploitation. This detection rule identifies script interpreters or suspicious processes connecting to known OAST domains, which may indicate exploitation activity or unauthorized security testing.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Verify with your security team whether authorized penetration testing or red team exercises are currently underway that would involve OAST services.\n- Review the process.name and process.executable fields to identify which application initiated the OAST connection and determine if it is a known vulnerable application.\n- Examine the dns.question.name field to capture the full OAST subdomain, as the subdomain often contains encoded data or unique identifiers used by attackers.\n- Analyze the process.parent.executable and process.command_line to understand how the connecting process was spawned and identify the potential vulnerability being exploited.\n- Check for any HTTP request or response data associated with the OAST connection to identify what data may have been exfiltrated.\n- Investigate the user.name and host.name to determine the scope of affected systems and user accounts.\n- Review web application logs and proxy data for injection attempts or exploitation activity that may have triggered the OAST callback.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Authorized security researchers and penetration testers may use OAST services during sanctioned vulnerability assessments. Confirm testing windows with the security team before escalating.\n- Bug bounty hunters testing your organization's applications may trigger OAST connections. Verify if bug bounty programs are active and expected.\n- Security training or capture-the-flag exercises may involve OAST services for educational purposes. Confirm with training coordinators if such exercises are scheduled.\n- Some commercial security scanning tools may use OAST-like services for vulnerability detection. Verify if automated security scanning is running.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized, immediately block the OAST domain at the network perimeter, DNS resolver, and proxy to prevent further communication.\n- Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement or additional data exfiltration.\n- Identify the vulnerable application or injection point that led to the OAST callback and apply emergency patches or mitigations.\n- Review the OAST subdomain and any captured data to assess the scope of information exposure.\n- Conduct a thorough code review of affected applications to identify and remediate the underlying vulnerability.\n- Implement web application firewall rules to detect and block common injection patterns that lead to OAST exploitation.\n- Escalate to the incident response team for further investigation if the activity indicates active exploitation or compromise.\n",
