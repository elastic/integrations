In credential compromise scenarios, attackers frequently attempt to retrieve as many secrets as \npossible in a short timeframe to escalate privileges or move laterally across the environment.\n\nThis threshold rule triggers when a single user identity successfully retrieves 20 or more unique secrets using \n`GetSecretValue` or `BatchGetSecretValue` within a short timespan. Retrieval of many different secrets in rapid succession is highly unusual and strongly associated with reconnaissance, secret harvesting, or compromised automation.\n\nNote: `BatchGetSecretValue` API calls the `GetSecretValue` API for each secret value; this alert only captures the `GetSecretValue` calls rather than the `BatchGetSecretValue` call itself.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the user or role**\n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn`, `user.name`, and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.type`.\n  - Determine whether the identity normally accesses Secrets Manager or is tied to a known automation workload.\n\n- **Analyze the set of secrets retrieved**\n  - Expand the alert in Timeline and review `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` for all `SecretId` values in the grouped threshold event.\n  - Identify whether the accessed secrets include:\n    - Privileged database credentials  \n    - IAM user or service account credentials  \n    - Production application secrets  \n    - Rarely accessed or high-sensitivity secrets  \n\n- **Assess the runtime context**\n  - Investigate `source.ip`, `source.geo.location`, and `user_agent.original`.\n  - Validate whether the calls originated from known internal automation (e.g., ECS task, Lambda runtime, EC2 instance profile) \n    or from an unexpected IP or user agent.\n\n- **Correlate with other activity from the same identity**\n  - Look for related reconnaissance or credential-access events:\n    - `ListSecrets`, `DescribeSecret`\n    - IAM enumeration (`ListUsers`, `GetCallerIdentity`)\n    - Role-chaining or unusual `AssumeRole` flows  \n  - Check for subsequent use of exposed credentials (RDS login attempts, API activity, abnormal resource access).\n\n- **Determine whether unusual automation or deployment activity is occurring**\n  - Confirm with application owners whether a new deployment, config reload, or migration might explain the multi-secret access.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Legitimate application initialization or rollouts may retrieve many secrets once on startup.\n- CI/CD pipelines or configuration management tools may enumerate secrets as part of environment bootstrapping.\n\nTo reduce noise, consider exceptions based on:\n- Known service roles  \n- Expected source IP ranges  \n- Specific application identities tied to secret orchestration  \n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Containment**\n  - Immediately revoke or disable the IAM user, role session, or instance profile if compromise is suspected.\n  - Quarantine EC2/ECS/Lambda resources originating suspicious calls.\n\n- **Investigation**\n  - Identify all secrets accessed in the grouped alert and determine where those credentials are used.\n  - Review CloudTrail for any suspicious follow-on activity using the retrieved secrets.\n  - Assess whether additional identities or workloads show similar enumeration behavior.\n\n- **Recovery and hardening**\n  - Rotate all accessed secrets and update dependent systems.\n  - Rotate IAM access keys or temporary credentials for the impacted identity.\n  - Restrict permissions to Secrets Manager following least privilege.\n  - Review automation and application behavior to ensure secrets are accessed only when required.\n",
