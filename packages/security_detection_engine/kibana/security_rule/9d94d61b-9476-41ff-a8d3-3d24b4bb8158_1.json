While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Tunneling and/or Port Forwarding Detected via Defend for Containers\n\nThis detects tunneling or port-forwarding tools launched inside Linux containers, which attackers use to create hidden pathways for command-and-control, data theft, or lateral movement across the container network. A common pattern is running SSH with local/remote/dynamic forwarding or tools like chisel/socat to expose an internal service (e.g., database or kube API) through an external relay, bypassing normal network controls and segmentation.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the owning workload (pod/deployment/cronjob), image tag, and recent rollout or configuration changes to determine whether the tunnel/forwarding behavior is expected for that service.  \n- Review the full executed command line, environment variables, and process ancestry to confirm what local/remote addresses and ports are being bridged and whether execution originated from an interactive session or startup script.  \n- Enumerate active listeners and established connections from the container/node at the time of the alert to find externally reachable forwards, unexpected egress destinations, and any traffic to known C2 or relay infrastructure.  \n- Correlate container network telemetry with DNS queries and outbound proxy usage to detect protocol tunneling patterns (e.g., long-lived sessions, high-entropy subdomains, unusual ports) and identify the initial ingress path.  \n- Check for follow-on actions in the container and cluster (new binaries dropped, modified entrypoints, created secrets/serviceaccounts, or lateral access attempts) that would indicate persistence or pivoting beyond simple debugging.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- A developer or SRE launches `ssh` with `-L`/`-R`/`-D` options from inside a container during troubleshooting to temporarily reach an internal service (e.g., database or API) from their workstation through the container network.  \n- A containerized service legitimately embeds proxying/forwarding behavior (e.g., `socat`, `3proxy`, `frps`, or `proxychains`) to expose or bridge ports as part of its normal runtime configuration, causing expected long-lived listeners and relayed connections that match tunnel/forwarding patterns.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Isolate the affected pod/container by scaling the workload to zero or cordoning/quarantining the node and applying a deny-all egress policy to stop the active tunnel/forward while preserving artifacts for collection.  \n- Terminate the tunneling process (e.g., ssh with -L/-R/-D, socat TCP4-LISTEN, chisel client/server, ngrok) and remove any dropped binaries or modified entrypoints/startup scripts that re-launch the forwarder.  \n- Capture and review the running command line, parent process chain, active listeners, and established connections to identify exposed internal services and block the destination IPs/domains/ports used by the tunnel at the network edge and cluster egress controls.  \n- Rotate potentially exposed credentials (Kubernetes service account tokens, cloud/API keys, database passwords) and validate RBAC/service account usage for unauthorized access originating from the affected workload.  \n- Rebuild and redeploy from a known-good image, pin image digests, and add admission controls to block images containing tunneling utilities or starting processes with port-forwarding arguments unless explicitly approved.  \n- Escalate to incident response immediately if the tunnel connects to external infrastructure, forwards access to sensitive services (e.g., kube-apiserver, etcd, databases), or similar tunneling behavior appears in multiple pods/namespaces.",
