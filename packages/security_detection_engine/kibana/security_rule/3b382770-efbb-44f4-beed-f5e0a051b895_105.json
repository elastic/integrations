While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Malware - Prevented - Elastic Endgame\n\nElastic Endgame is a security solution designed to prevent malware by analyzing and classifying files in real-time. Adversaries may attempt to bypass such defenses by disguising malicious files to evade detection. The detection rule identifies prevention events where Elastic Endgame has successfully blocked a file classified as malware, focusing on alerts generated by file classification activities. This helps security analysts quickly respond to and investigate potential threats.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the alert details to confirm the event.kind is 'alert' and event.module is 'endgame', ensuring the alert is relevant to the Elastic Endgame prevention mechanism.\n- Examine the endgame.metadata.type field to verify it is 'prevention', indicating that the alert pertains to a successfully blocked malware attempt.\n- Investigate the event.action or endgame.event_subtype_full fields to understand the specific file classification event that triggered the alert.\n- Gather additional context by checking the file path, hash, and any associated metadata to identify the potentially malicious file and its origin.\n- Cross-reference the alert with other security logs and alerts to determine if there are related events or patterns that could indicate a broader attack campaign.\n- Assess the risk score and severity to prioritize the investigation and response efforts, considering the high severity and risk score of 73.\n- Utilize the Elastic Endgame interface or provided links for further information and context about the specific prevention event and any recommended remediation actions.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Legitimate software updates or installations may trigger the rule if they involve file classification activities. To manage this, create exceptions for known and trusted software update processes.\n- Security tools or system processes that perform file scanning or classification might be flagged. Identify these processes and add them to an exception list to prevent unnecessary alerts.\n- Custom scripts or applications developed in-house that perform file operations similar to malware can be mistaken for threats. Review these scripts and whitelist them if they are verified as safe.\n- Frequent alerts from specific directories known to contain non-malicious files, such as temporary or backup folders, can be excluded by specifying these paths in the rule exceptions.\n- If certain file types are consistently misclassified as threats, consider adjusting the rule to exclude these file types after confirming they are not harmful.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent the spread of malware to other parts of the network. Disconnect the system from the network and any shared drives.\n- Verify the alert by cross-referencing the blocked file details with known malware signatures or threat intelligence sources to confirm the threat.\n- Remove the malicious file from the system using a trusted antivirus or endpoint protection tool. Ensure that the file is quarantined or deleted to prevent re-execution.\n- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system and any connected devices to identify and remove any additional malicious files or remnants.\n- Restore any affected files or systems from a clean backup, ensuring that the backup is free from malware before restoration.\n- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further analysis and to determine if additional systems may be compromised.\n- Review and update security policies and endpoint protection configurations to enhance detection and prevention capabilities against similar threats in the future.",
