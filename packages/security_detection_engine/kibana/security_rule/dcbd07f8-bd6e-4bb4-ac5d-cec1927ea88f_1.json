You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the \"Definition\" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html).\n\n### GCP Audit logs Integration Setup\nThe Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Audit logs integration allows you to collect logs and metrics from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Elastic Agent.\n\n#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System \"Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Audit logs\" integration to your system:\n- Go to the Kibana home page and click \u201cAdd integrations\u201d.\n- In the query bar, search for \u201cGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) Audit logs\u201d and select the integration to see more details about it.\n- Click \u201cAdd Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Audit logs\".\n- Configure the integration.\n- Click \u201cSave and Continue\u201d.\n- For more details on the integration refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/gcp).\n",
