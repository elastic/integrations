        "description": "This rule alerts on processes exhibiting high CPU usage and that are observed for the first time in the previous 5 days. A previously unseen process consuming sustained CPU resources may indicate suspicious activity such as cryptomining, exploit payload execution, or other forms of resource abuse following host compromise. In some cases, this may also surface legitimate but unexpected software causing performance degradation.",
