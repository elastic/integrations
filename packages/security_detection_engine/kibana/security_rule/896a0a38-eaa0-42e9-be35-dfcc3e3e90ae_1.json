An overly permissive policy effectively bypasses all firewall protections. Threat actors exploiting CVE-2026-24858 have been observed creating such policies to allow unrestricted traffic flow through compromised FortiGate devices.",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating FortiGate Overly Permissive Firewall Policy Created\n\nThis alert indicates that a firewall policy was created or modified on a FortiGate device with source address `all`, destination address `all`, and service `ALL`. This configuration effectively disables firewall enforcement for traffic matching the policy.\n\nIn the FG-IR-26-060 campaign, threat actors created these permissive policies to ensure their traffic could traverse the firewall without restriction.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review `source.user.name` to determine which account created or modified the policy and `fortinet.firewall.ui` for the source interface and IP address. Verify whether this administrator is authorized to make firewall policy changes.\n- Examine `fortinet.firewall.cfgattr` for the full policy configuration including interfaces, NAT settings, and scheduling. Check `fortinet.firewall.cfgobj` for the affected policy ID and determine whether the policy is positioned to intercept traffic (policy ordering matters).\n- Look for administrator account creation, SSO login events, or configuration exports preceding this change. Determine whether the administrator account itself was recently created.\n- Identify which interfaces the policy applies to (srcintf/dstintf in cfgattr) and determine whether the policy enables inbound, outbound, or both directions of unrestricted traffic.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Temporary troubleshooting policies created during network diagnostics (should be time-limited and removed).\n- Initial device setup or lab environments where broad policies are intentionally configured.\n- Migration or cutover scenarios where temporary permissive rules are needed.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized, immediately delete the permissive firewall policy and audit the administrator account that created it for compromise.\n- Review all other firewall policies for unauthorized modifications and check for other indicators of compromise on the device (rogue admins, VPN users).\n- Restore the policy configuration from a known-clean backup.\n- If the activity is expected, document the business justification and ensure a removal timeline is defined. Replace with specific source/destination/service rules as soon as possible.",
