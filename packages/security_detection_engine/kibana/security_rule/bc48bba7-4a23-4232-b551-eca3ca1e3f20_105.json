        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n## Investigation Guide: Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access Policy (CAP) Modified\n\nAzure Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) are critical for enforcing secure access requirements such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), restricting specific users or groups, and managing sign-in conditions. Modifying these policies can be a technique for weakening an organization\u2019s defenses and maintaining persistence after initial access.\n\nThis rule detects a successful update to a Conditional Access Policy in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).\n\n### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify the user who modified the policy:**\n  - Check the value of `azure.auditlogs.properties.initiated_by.user.userPrincipalName` to determine the identity that made the change.\n  - Investigate their recent activity to determine if this change was expected or authorized.\n\n- **Review the modified policy name:**\n  - Look at `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.*.display_name` to find the name of the affected policy.\n  - Determine whether this policy is related to critical controls (e.g., requiring MFA for admins).\n\n- **Analyze the policy change:**\n  - Compare the `old_value` and `new_value` fields under `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.*.modified_properties.*`.\n  - Look for security-reducing changes, such as:\n    - Removing users/groups from enforcement.\n    - Disabling MFA or risk-based conditions.\n    - Introducing exclusions that reduce the policy\u2019s coverage.\n\n- **Correlate with other activity:**\n  - Pivot on `azure.auditlogs.properties.activity_datetime` to identify if any suspicious sign-ins occurred after the policy was modified.\n  - Check for related authentication logs, particularly from the same IP address (`azure.auditlogs.properties.initiated_by.user.ipAddress`).\n\n- **Assess the user's legitimacy:**\n  - Review the initiator\u2019s Azure role, group memberships, and whether their account was recently elevated or compromised.\n  - Investigate whether this user has a history of modifying policies or if this is anomalous.\n\n### Validation & False Positive Considerations\n\n- **Authorized administrative changes:** Some organizations routinely update CAPs as part of policy tuning or role-based access reviews.\n- **Security reviews or automation:** Scripts, CI/CD processes, or third-party compliance tools may programmatically update CAPs.\n- **Employee lifecycle events:** Policy changes during employee onboarding/offboarding may include updates to access policies.\n\nIf any of these cases apply and align with the activity's context, consider tuning the rule or adding exceptions for expected patterns.\n\n### Response & Remediation\n\n- Revert unauthorized or insecure changes to the Conditional Access Policy immediately.\n- Temporarily increase monitoring of CAP modifications and sign-in attempts.\n- Lock or reset the credentials of the user account that made the change if compromise is suspected.\n- Conduct a broader access review of conditional access policies and privileged user activity.\n- Implement stricter change management and alerting around CAP changes.\n",
