        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Route 53 Resolver Query Log Configuration Deleted\n\nRoute 53 Resolver query logs provide essential telemetry for DNS visibility across AWS environments. Deleting a Resolver Query Log Configuration immediately halts DNS logging for one or more VPCs, creating a significant monitoring gap. Adversaries may intentionally delete these configurations to hide malicious activity. This rule detects successful invocations of `DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig`.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n**Validate the actor and request origin**\n- Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to determine who initiated the deletion. Confirm whether the identity normally manages Route53 Resolver resources or VPC-level DNS configuration.\n- Examine `source.ip`, `source.address`, `source.geo` fields and `user_agent.original` to determine whether the request originated from an expected network path or automation role. Whether API calls were made via console, CLI, SDK, or custom tooling.\n\n**Understand what was deleted and the impacted environment**\n- Inspect `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements` to identify the Query Log Configuration ID, Associated VPCs and destinations (e.g., CloudWatch Log Group, S3 bucket, Kinesis stream).\n- Determine whether these VPCs support production workloads, contain regulated or sensitive data, host internet-facing or privileged workloads (e.g., EKS clusters, directory services, bastion hosts).\n\n**Correlate for intent and related activity**\n- Use `@timestamp` to correlate the deletion with:\n  - Prior `PutResolverQueryLogConfig` or `AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig` modifications.\n  - IAM permission changes or STS session activities.\n  - Recent DNS anomalies if logs were active prior to deletion.\n- Pivot on the same `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to identify:\n  - Additional logging-related tampering (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, S3 server access logs).\n  - Resource isolation or privilege escalation attempts.\n  - Suspicious EC2, Lambda, or container workload behavior.\n\n**Validate operational context**\n- Check whether a change request, maintenance window, or migration task was underway that could explain the deletion.\n- Confirm with networking, SRE, or platform engineering teams whether a logging pipeline redesign was in progress, a deprecated log config was intentionally removed, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) automation recently applied updates that removed the configuration.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Legitimate network and logging redesign**  \n  - Deletions performed during planned VPC migrations, resolver logging pipeline upgrades, or CloudWatch/S3 restructuring may be benign.\n- **Expected IaC behavior**  \n  - Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK stacks may destroy and recreate logging configurations during updates.  \n    Validate pipeline activity and automation roles to avoid noise.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n**Contain and restore visibility**\n- If unauthorized activity is suspected:\n  - Immediately re-create the Resolver Query Log Configuration.\n  - Re-associate the configuration with the affected VPCs to restore DNS visibility.\n  - Verify that CloudWatch Log Groups or S3 destinations have not been deleted or altered.\n\n**Investigate access and scope of impact**\n- Review IAM permissions assigned to the actor:\n  - Identify whether privilege escalation or role compromise occurred.\n  - Validate that other high-impact logging or monitoring configurations (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty) remain intact.\n- Perform a DNS-focused threat hunt:\n  - Analyze prior logged queries for indicators of malware, C2 infrastructure, or suspicious domains before the logging gap.\n\n**Strengthen defensive controls**\n- Restrict sensitive operations by:\n  - Limiting `route53resolver:DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig` to a small number of privileged roles.\n  - Adding IAM condition keys to constrain deletion operations by source IP, region, or principal ARN.\n- Enable AWS Config or Security Hub controls that:\n  - Detect missing or deleted query log configurations.\n  - Enforce continuous logging for critical VPCs.\n\n### Additional information\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **[AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/)**\n",
