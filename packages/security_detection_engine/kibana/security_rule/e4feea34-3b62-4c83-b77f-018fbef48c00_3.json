Additionally, when a user creates or enables a Virtual MFA device through the AWS Management Console, the underlying CloudTrail event will also show a temporary credential (access key ID beginning with ASIA), because the console itself issues short-lived STS session credentials for every logged-in user.

        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n> **Disclaimer**:\n> This investigation guide was created using generative AI technology and validated for accuracy and relevance. Always\n> tailor the steps to your organization's environment and operational context.\n\n### Investigating AWS IAM Virtual MFA Device Registration Attempt with Session Token\n\nTemporary credentials that start with the prefix `ASIA` are generated by the AWS Security Token Service (STS). These\nsession tokens are used for short-lived operations and should not be used to modify or register IAM\nauthentication mechanisms. This rule detects cases where an IAM user or role uses such temporary credentials to invoke either `CreateVirtualMFADevice` or `EnableMFADevice`.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor and session context**\n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to determine the identity and confirm the `ASIA` prefix.  \n  - If you ingest `event.original`, look for `sessionCredentialFromConsole: true` to determine if the temporary token is from a console login session (which uses temporary session tokens in the backend) rather than compromised session tokens.\n  - Check `user_agent.original`, `source.ip`, and `cloud.region` to determine if this activity originated from an expected host, VPN, or location.\n  - Cross-reference with prior activity by this identity\u2014especially `GetSessionToken`, `AssumeRole`, or `GetCallerIdentity` calls.\n\n- **Correlate related IAM events**\n  - Search for subsequent or preceding calls to:\n    - `EnableMFADevice` (after `CreateVirtualMFADevice`)\n    - `DeactivateMFADevice` or `DeleteVirtualMFADevice`\n    - `ListMFADevices`, `ListUsers`, or `UpdateLoginProfile`\n  - Review whether new MFA devices were successfully enabled (`event.outcome:success`).\n\n- **Assess session scope and privileges**\n  - Identify what IAM policies are attached to the user or role that issued this request.  \n  - If the temporary credentials were created via `AssumeRole` or `GetSessionToken`, check the originating principal\u2019s permissions.\n\n- **Investigate possible persistence**\n  - Look for new MFA devices listed for privileged users (e.g., account root or admin roles).  \n  - Review login history for those accounts following the MFA change. \n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Legitimate Administrative or Automated Actions**  \n  Certain IAM administrative workflows or CI/CD automation tools may register or enable MFA devices using temporary\n  session credentials. Confirm whether the calling principal is part of an authorized automation process or a known\n  identity performing account configuration tasks.\n\n- **Expected Console Behavior**  \n  When users create or enable Virtual MFA devices through the **AWS Management Console**, AWS automatically issues\n  temporary STS credentials (with access key IDs beginning with `ASIA`) for that session. As a result, these events will\n  appear identical to programmatic usage of session tokens in CloudTrail logs.  \n  This is expected and does not indicate compromise.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Immediate containment**\n  - Revoke or expire the temporary credentials (`aws sts revoke-session` if applicable).  \n  - Disable or delete any newly created virtual MFA devices using `DeleteVirtualMFADevice`.  \n  - Rotate passwords and long-term access keys for the associated IAM users.\n\n- **Investigation and scoping**\n  - Review CloudTrail logs for related IAM modifications (`UpdateLoginProfile`, `AttachUserPolicy`, `CreateAccessKey`).  \n  - Identify any new API keys or tokens created after the MFA registration.  \n  - Cross-check whether the attacker leveraged the new MFA binding for session persistence or login.\n\n- **Recovery and hardening**\n  - Enforce the `iam:EnableMFADevice` and `iam:CreateVirtualMFADevice` permissions only for trusted admin roles.  \n  - Implement `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` conditions in IAM policies.  \n  - Monitor for any future `ASIA` credential\u2013based IAM configuration changes.\n\n### Additional information\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **[Managing MFA Devices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html)** \n",
