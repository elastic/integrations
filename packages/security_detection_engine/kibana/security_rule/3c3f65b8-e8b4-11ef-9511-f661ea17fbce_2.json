        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS SNS Topic Created by Rare User\n\nThis rule detects the creation of an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic by a user who does not typically perform this action. Adversaries may create SNS topics to facilitate data exfiltration or other malicious activities.\n\nThis is a [New Terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) rule that only flags when this behavior is observed for the first time on a host in the last 10 days.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n### 1. Identify the Actor and Context\n- **User Identity and Role**:\n  - Examine `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to determine **who** created the SNS topic.\n  - Identify whether the actor assumed a **privileged IAM role** (`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.type: \"AssumedRole\"`).\n- **User Agent and Tooling**:\n  - Check `user_agent.name` to determine if this action was performed via the AWS CLI, SDK, or Console.\n  - If `aws-cli` was used, review whether it aligns with typical automation or administrative behavior.\n- **Source IP and Geographic Location**:\n  - Review `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to confirm if the request originated from a **trusted** or **unexpected** location.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the SNS Topic Creation\n- **Topic Name and Purpose**:\n  - Check `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.name` for the **SNS topic name** and determine whether it appears suspicious (e.g., random strings, unusual keywords).\n- **Target Region and Account**:\n  - Verify `cloud.region` and `cloud.account.id` to **ensure the SNS topic was created in an expected environment**.\n- **Associated API Calls**:\n  - Identify additional actions **before or after** this event using `event.action` values like:\n    - `Subscribe`\n    - `Publish`\n    - `SetTopicAttributes`\n  - These may indicate follow-up steps taken to misuse the SNS topic.\n\n### 3. Analyze Potential Malicious Intent\n- **Is This an Isolated Action or a Pattern?**\n  - Check if this **user has previously created SNS topics** using historical CloudTrail logs.\n  - Look for **multiple topic creations in a short period**, which may suggest an automation script or malicious behavior.\n- **Unusual Role Usage**:\n  - If `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` references an **EC2 instance role**, verify whether that instance typically performs SNS operations.\n- **Potential Data Exfiltration or Persistence**:\n  - Review whether **new subscriptions** were added (`Subscribe` API action) to forward data externally.\n  - If an SNS topic was configured to trigger **Lambda functions or S3 events**, it may indicate an attempt to persist in the environment.\n\n## False Positive Analysis\n- **Legitimate Usage of SNS**:\n  - SNS is commonly used for **event-driven notifications** in AWS.\n  - Check whether the SNS topic creation aligns with known **DevOps, automation, or monitoring activities**.\n- **Routine IAM Role Activity**:\n  - If the user typically interacts with SNS, consider **allowlisting** expected IAM roles for this action.\n- **AWS Services Creating Topics Automatically**:\n  - Some AWS services may **auto-create SNS topics** for alerts and monitoring. Confirm whether the creation was system-generated.\n\n## Response and Remediation\n- **Confirm Authorization**:\n  - If the user was not expected to create SNS topics, verify whether their IAM permissions should be restricted.\n- **Revoke Unauthorized Access**:\n  - If unauthorized, disable the access keys or IAM role associated with the event.\n- **Monitor for Further SNS Modifications**:\n  - Set up additional monitoring for **SNS Publish or Subscription events** (`Publish`, `Subscribe`).\n- **Enhance IAM Policy Controls**:\n  - Consider enforcing **least privilege** IAM policies and enabling **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where applicable.\n- **Investigate for Persistence**:\n  - Check whether the SNS topic is **being used as a notification channel for Lambda, S3, or other AWS services**.\n",
