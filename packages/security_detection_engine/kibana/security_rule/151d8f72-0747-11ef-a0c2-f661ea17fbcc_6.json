        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Lambda Function Policy Updated to Allow Public Invocation\n\nAWS Lambda policies control who can invoke a function. When the `Principal` is set to `*`, the function becomes publicly invokable by any AWS account. Adversaries may modify Lambda permissions to create a stealthy execution backdoor or to maintain persistence inside an AWS environment. This activity is uncommon in most production environments and should receive careful scrutiny when detected.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n**Identify the actor**\n- Identify the actor who made the change by reviewing `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and access key ID. Determine whether this principal typically administers Lambda functions.\n\n**Review request details**\n- Review request details in `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` to understand the exact permission added:\n  - Confirm that the `Principal` is set to `\"*\"`.\n  - Note the `Action` (`lambda:InvokeFunction`) and any `SourceArn` restrictions (sometimes present, often missing in malicious cases).\n\n**Analyze source context**\n- Check the source of the request using `source.ip`, geo information, and user agent. Unexpected networks, automation tools, or CLI usage may indicate credential compromise.\n\n**Correlate timing and related events**\n- Evaluate timing and sequence by correlating `@timestamp` with other events. Look for surrounding actions such as:\n  - Creation or update of Lambda function code.\n  - Publishing new Lambda layers.\n  - Changes to roles attached to the function.\n\n**Assess function sensitivity and impact**\n- Assess the function\u2019s role and data sensitivity. Determine whether public invocation could:\n  - Enable unmonitored code execution,\n  - Trigger access to internal resources via the function\u2019s IAM role,\n  - Be chained with persistence or privilege escalation behavior.\n\n**Validate operational intent**\n- Validate the operational context. Confirm with the function owner whether the permission change was intentional, part of a deployment, or unexpected.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Public invocation may be intentional for certain workloads (e.g., webhook handlers, openly accessible compute functions). Compare the event with documentation, IaC templates, or the deployment pipeline.\n- Some teams may regularly modify permissions during testing or refactoring; check whether this aligns with existing workflows.\n- Evaluate whether the function already had permissive invocation policies and whether the update is part of expected configuration drift.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Remove unauthorized public invocation permissions immediately by reverting the Lambda function policy to the approved baseline.\n- Investigate for follow-on activity: execution of the function, updates to code, modifications to IAM roles, or API calls issued using the function's role.\n- Rotate or disable credentials associated with the identity that issued the `AddPermission` call if compromise is suspected.\n- Enable or refine monitoring for Lambda policy updates, layer additions, and code changes to detect future unauthorized modifications.\n- Conduct a security review of the Lambda function and any downstream resources it can access to ensure no misuse has occurred.\n- Work with the application team to enforce least-privilege invocation policies and deploy guardrails (e.g., SCPs, IAM Conditions, or automated compliance checks) preventing public invocation unless explicitly authorized.\n\n### Additional information\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **[AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/)**\n",
