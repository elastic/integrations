        "note": "## Investigating AWS S3 Unauthenticated Bucket Access by Rare Source\n\nThis rule detects requests to an AWS S3 bucket by an unauthenticated source, which could indicate a misconfigured bucket policy allowing public access. Adversaries can exploit this misconfiguration by using tools or AWS CLI options like `--no-sign-request` to access bucket contents.\n\nThe rule triggers when an unauthenticated IP address retrieves an object, and that IP has not been seen in the last 7 days.\n\n### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n1. **Identify the Source of the Request**:\n    - Review the `source.address` field to determine the IP address of the request source.\n    - Check `source.geo` fields for geographic details of the originating IP address.\n    - Analyze the `user_agent.original` field to identify the client or tool used (e.g., `Python Requests`, `aws-cli`, browser).\n\n2. **Review the Accessed Bucket and Object**:\n    - Analyze the `aws.cloudtrail.resources.arn` field to identify the S3 bucket and object being accessed.\n    - Inspect `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` for bucket name and object key to determine which file was retrieved.\n    - Review the `even.action` field to identify which API call was made (e.g., `GetObject`, `ListObjects`, `PutObject`, `ListBucket`).\n\n3. **Validate the Source IP and Context**:\n    - Determine if the IP address (`source.address`) has any prior activity in your environment.\n    - Correlate the IP with threat intelligence or blocklist databases to check for malicious indicators.\n    - Review CloudTrail logs for other activities originating from the same IP.\n\n4. **Analyze the S3 Bucket Configuration**:\n    - Review the S3 bucket's Access Control List (ACL) and bucket policy to check for misconfigurations allowing public or unauthenticated access.\n    - Look for overly permissive settings, such as `Principal: *` or `Effect: Allow` rules that expose the bucket.\n\n5. **Investigate Additional Activity**:\n    - Check if there are subsequent actions, such as:\n        - **Additional `GetObject` API calls**: Indicating further data exfiltration.\n        - **ListObjects requests**: Attempting to enumerate the bucket's contents.\n    - Correlate events within the same timeframe to identify related suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Assess the Data Exposed**:\n    - Identify the retrieved object(s) and analyze their content to assess potential data exposure.\n    - Determine if the file contains sensitive information, such as credentials, intellectual property, or PII.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Public Buckets by Design**: Some S3 buckets may intentionally allow public access. Verify with the bucket owner if the access was expected.\n- **Automated Tools**: Security scanners or legitimate services may generate `GetObject` events to validate bucket configurations.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n1. **Immediate Action**:\n    - Restrict or remove public access to the affected S3 bucket.\n    - Update the bucket policy to ensure access is restricted to trusted principals.\n    - Enable **S3 Block Public Access** settings to prevent unintended public access.\n\n2. **Monitoring and Detection**:\n    - Enable detailed logging and monitoring for all S3 bucket activities.\n    - Configure real-time alerts for unauthenticated `GetObject` or `ListObjects` events on sensitive S3 buckets.\n\n3. **Security Audits**:\n    - Regularly audit S3 bucket policies and ACLs to ensure they adhere to AWS security best practices.\n    - Use AWS tools like **Trusted Advisor** or **Access Analyzer** to identify and address misconfigurations.\n\n4. **Investigate for Data Exfiltration**:\n    - Analyze historical CloudTrail logs to determine if other sensitive files were accessed or exfiltrated.\n    - Assess the scope of the exposure and initiate further response if sensitive data was compromised.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- [AWS Documentation: S3 Bucket Policy Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html)\n- [AWS S3 Block Public Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html)\n",
