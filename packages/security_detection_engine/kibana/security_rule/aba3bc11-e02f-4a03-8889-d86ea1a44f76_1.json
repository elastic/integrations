While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Perl Outbound Network Connection\n\nThis rule detects Perl starting on macOS and then initiating an outbound connection to a public (non-private) IP, a pattern that stands out because Perl rarely performs direct network reach-outs in normal macOS workflows. Attackers often abuse Perl as a built-in \u201cliving off the land\u201d runtime to beacon to external command-and-control over HTTP/S or to fetch and execute a second-stage payload from an internet host.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the full command line, parent/child process tree, execution context (user, TTY, working directory), and referenced script/module paths to determine whether the run was expected or suspicious.  \n- Pivot on the external destination (IP, port, and any resolved domain from DNS telemetry) to assess reputation, hosting characteristics, and whether other endpoints have recently contacted the same infrastructure.  \n- Examine connection characteristics (protocol, TLS SNI/certificate, HTTP headers/user-agent, data volume, and timing) to identify staged downloads or beacon-like periodicity.  \n- Correlate nearby file activity for newly created or modified scripts, temp artifacts, or downloaded payloads, and validate them via hashes, signatures, and known-good baselines.  \n- Check for follow-on behavior consistent with persistence or lateral movement, such as new launchd/cron items, suspicious login items, or additional interpreters and shells spawned from the same lineage.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- A legitimate Perl script run by an administrator or scheduled maintenance task (e.g., log rotation, health checks, or API polling) may connect to a public service endpoint over HTTP/S, matching the Perl exec followed by a non-private destination IP pattern.  \n- A developer workflow that uses Perl one-liners or project scripts to fetch dependencies, query internet-hosted resources, or validate external URLs can generate outbound connections to public IPs that appear unusual on endpoints without an established baseline for Perl network use.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Isolate the affected macOS host from the network (or block the specific destination IP/port at the egress firewall) and terminate the suspicious `perl` process to stop any active command-and-control or payload download.  \n- Collect and preserve the Perl command line, referenced script paths, current working directory, any newly written files (especially in `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and the user\u2019s `~/Library`), and the full process tree for forensic review before cleanup.  \n- Remove or quarantine the identified Perl script and any downloaded payloads, then eradicate persistence by deleting malicious `launchd` agents/daemons, cron entries, and suspicious Login Items created around the time of the outbound connection.  \n- Reimage or restore the endpoint from a known-good source if integrity cannot be confidently validated, rotate credentials used on the device, and invalidate active sessions/tokens that may have been exposed to the Perl process.  \n- Escalate to IR/forensics immediately if the destination infrastructure is contacted by multiple hosts, the Perl process runs under a privileged context, or you observe repeated beacon-like connections or evidence of persistence beyond a single script execution.  \n- Harden by restricting interpreter execution (Perl, Python, Ruby) via endpoint controls, enforcing outbound allowlisting/proxying for user endpoints, and adding detections for Perl launching network tools or writing executable content into user-writable directories.\n",
