        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS RDS DB Instance or Cluster Password Modified\n\nThe RDS master user password controls privileged access to a database instance or cluster. Modifying it can immediately shift access from one operator to another, break application functionality, or allow an adversary to regain control over a compromised DB instance. Because RDS never returns the password via API, this operation is a strong signal of intentional access reconfiguration.\n\nThis rule detects successful password-modification events via `ModifyDBInstance` or `ModifyDBCluster`. Such changes may indicate credential loss recovery\u2014or malicious actions related to persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor and execution context**  \n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id`.  \n  - Inspect `user.name`, `source.ip`, and `user_agent.original` to determine whether the modification originated from expected networks, automation roles, or unusual sources.\n\n- **Determine what was modified**  \n  - Examine `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` to identify:  \n    - The DB instance or cluster identifier.  \n    - Whether other parameters were modified in the same call (e.g., `manageMasterUserPassword`, engine version, instance class, parameter group).  \n  - Review instance metadata in AWS to understand the sensitivity level, environment (prod/stage/dev), and potential business impact.\n\n- **Reconstruct timing and associated actions**  \n  - Use `@timestamp` to compare the event against:  \n    - Recent configuration changes such as `ModifyDBInstance`, `ModifyDBCluster`, or networking/security group updates.  \n    - Other access-related operations (e.g., `AddRoleToDBInstance`, changes to Secrets Manager associations, disabling deletion protection).  \n  - Check for signs of credential misuse leading up to the event (e.g., `DescribeDBInstances`, `GetCallerIdentity`, unauthorized console logins).\n\n- **Correlate with broader activity**  \n  - Pivot in CloudTrail using the same access key, principal ARN, or source IP.  \n  - Look for:  \n    - Privilege-escalating or persistence-related behavior (IAM policy changes, role modifications, STS session creation).  \n    - Subsequent DB-impacting operations, such as snapshot deletion, backup retention changes, or cluster deletion.  \n    - Evidence of data access anomalies (backup exports, data snapshot copies, cross-region actions).\n\n- **Validate intent with operational owners**  \n  - Confirm with DBAs, platform engineers, and application owners whether the password change:  \n    - Was requested or scheduled.  \n    - Aligns with pending migrations, credential rotations, or recovery actions.  \n  - If not recognized, treat this as a high-risk event requiring deeper containment.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Recovery or maintenance tasks**  \n  - Password resets occur during lost-credential scenarios or planned rotations. Confirm if this aligns with a documented workflow.\n- **Secrets Manager integration changes**  \n  - When `manageMasterUserPassword` is toggled or Secrets Manager rotates passwords, a modification event may occur. Validate whether an automation pipeline triggered the change.\n- **Non-production workloads**  \n  - Development or staging environments may see frequent password resets. Consider tuning exceptions based on tags, instance identifiers, or IAM roles tied to automation.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Contain unauthorized access**  \n  - If activity is suspicious:  \n    - Immediately rotate the master password again using a secure, validated workflow.  \n    - Verify whether Secrets Manager integration was disabled (`manageMasterUserPassword=false`) and restore it if necessary.  \n    - Restrict inbound DB access by tightening associated security group rules or isolating the instance temporarily.\n\n- **Investigate surrounding activity**  \n  - Review CloudTrail to identify:  \n    - Who accessed the instance after the password change.  \n    - Whether any destructive or data-exfiltrating RDS actions occurred.  \n    - Other IAM or STS activity tied to the same user or session.\n\n- **Restore guardrails and enhance monitoring**  \n  - Ensure deletion protection, backup retention, and networking controls are correctly configured.  \n  - Add real-time alerts for password-related modifications and high-risk RDS API actions.\n\n- **Strengthen IAM and operational controls**  \n  - Limit permissions for `rds:ModifyDBInstance` and `rds:ModifyDBCluster`, especially when modifying authentication parameters.  \n  - Require MFA and role-based access for DB administrators.  \n  - Tighten SCPs or Config rules to restrict unauthorized DB configuration changes.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **Security Best Practices:** [AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/).\n",
