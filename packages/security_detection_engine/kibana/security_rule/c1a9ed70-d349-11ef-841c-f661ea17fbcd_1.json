        "note": "### Triage and Analysis\n\n#### Investigating Unusual AWS S3 Object Encryption with SSE-C\nThis rule identifies the use of Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) in AWS S3. This could indicate malicious activity, such as ransomware encrypting objects, rendering them inaccessible without the corresponding encryption keys.\n\n##### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n1. **Identify the User and Source**:\n   - Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to identify the IAM user or role performing the operation.\n   - Cross-check the `source.ip` and `user_agent.original` fields for unusual IPs or user agents that could indicate unauthorized access.\n   - Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to identify the access key used. This could be a compromised key.\n\n2. **Examine the Targeted Resources**:\n   - Check `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.bucketName` to identify the bucket involved.\n   - Analyze the object key from `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.key`.\n\n3. **Evaluate Encryption Behavior**:\n   - Confirm the encryption details in `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` and `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.additional_eventdata.SSEApplied`.\n   - Note if `SSEApplied` is `SSE-C`, which confirms encryption using a customer-provided key.\n\n4. **Correlate with Recent Events**:\n   - Look for any suspicious activity in proximity to the encryption event, such as new access key creation, policy changes, or unusual access patterns from the same user or IP.\n   - Identify `ListBucket` or `GetObject` operations on the same bucket to determine all affected objects.\n   - For `PutObject` events, identify any other unusual objecs uploaded such as a ransom note.\n\n5. **Validate Access Permissions**:\n   - Check the IAM policies and roles associated with the user to verify if they had legitimate access to encrypt objects.\n\n6. **Assess Impact**:\n   - Identify the number of encrypted objects in the bucket by examining other similar events.\n   - Determine if this encryption aligns with standard business practices or constitutes a deviation.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Legitimate Use Cases**:\n  - Confirm if SSE-C encryption is part of regular operations for compliance or data protection.\n  - Cross-reference known processes or users authorized for SSE-C encryption in the affected bucket.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n1. **Immediate Actions**:\n   - Disable access keys or permissions for the user if unauthorized behavior is confirmed.\n   - Rotate the bucket's encryption configuration to mitigate further misuse.\n\n2. **Data Recovery**:\n   - Attempt to identify and contact the party holding the SSE-C encryption keys if recovery is necessary.\n\n3. **Enhance Monitoring**:\n   - Enable alerts for future SSE-C encryption attempts in critical buckets.\n   - Review and tighten IAM policies for roles and users accessing S3.\n\n4. **Post-Incident Review**:\n   - Audit logs for additional activities by the same user or IP.\n   - Document findings and apply lessons learned to improve preventive measures.\n",
