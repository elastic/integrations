        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n> **Disclaimer**:\n> This investigation guide was created using generative AI technology and has been reviewed to improve its accuracy and relevance. \n> While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating AWS GuardDuty Detector Deletion\n\nAmazon GuardDuty is a continuous threat detection service that analyzes CloudTrail, DNS, and VPC Flow Logs to identify malicious activity and compromised resources. Deleting a GuardDuty detector stops this monitoring entirely and permanently removes all historical findings for the affected AWS account. This rule detects successful `DeleteDetector` API calls, which may represent an attacker attempting to impair defenses and evade detection. Such actions should be rare and always performed under controlled administrative change processes.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor**\n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.type` to determine who initiated the deletion.\n  - Verify whether this principal normally performs GuardDuty configuration or administrative tasks.\n\n- **Review request context**\n  - Check `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `cloud.region` to confirm the targeted GuardDuty detector and scope of impact.\n  - Determine whether multiple detectors or member accounts were affected (especially in delegated admin organizations).\n\n- **Analyze source and access patterns**\n  - Review `source.ip`, `user_agent.original` and `source.geo` fields for anomalous or previously unseen access locations or automation clients.\n  - Check whether the deletion occurred outside standard maintenance windows or during a concurrent suspicious activity window.\n\n- **Correlate with preceding or related activity**\n  - Search for earlier GuardDuty configuration changes:\n    - `StopMonitoringMembers`, `DisassociateMembers`, or `DeleteMembers`\n    - IAM role or policy modifications reducing GuardDuty privileges\n  - Look for other defense evasion indicators such as CloudTrail suspension, Security Hub configuration changes, or disabling of AWS Config rules.\n\n- **Review historical GuardDuty findings**\n  - Examine prior GuardDuty alerts and findings (if still retrievable) to determine whether the deletion followed significant detection activity.\n  - Use centralized logs or security data lakes to recover findings removed from the console.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Authorized administrative actions**\n  - Verify whether the deletion corresponds to legitimate account decommissioning, region cleanup, or migration activity.\n- **Automation or IaC**\n  - GuardDuty may be disabled temporarily during infrastructure provisioning or teardown in automated environments. \n    Confirm via CI/CD logs or Infrastructure-as-Code templates.\n- **Organizational configuration changes**\n  - Large organizations might consolidate GuardDuty under a delegated administrator account, causing detectors to be deleted in member accounts. \n    Validate these actions against security architecture changes.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Containment and restoration**\n  - If unauthorized, immediately re-enable GuardDuty in the affected account and region using the `CreateDetector` API or AWS console.\n  - Verify that findings aggregation and member account associations are restored to expected configurations.\n\n- **Investigation**\n  - Review CloudTrail for related privilege escalation or resource tampering events around the deletion time.\n  - Assess whether any attacker activity occurred during the monitoring gap between deletion and restoration.\n\n- **Recovery and hardening**\n  - Restrict `guardduty:DeleteDetector` permissions to a limited administrative role.\n  - Implement AWS Config rules or Security Hub controls to alert on changes to GuardDuty detectors or configuration states.\n  - Enforce least privilege IAM policies, ensuring operational automation cannot disable GuardDuty outside maintenance workflows.\n  - Document approved GuardDuty maintenance activities and correlate them with change tickets for traceability.\n\n### Additional information\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **Security Best Practices:** [AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/).\n",
