        "description": "Identifies attempts to register a new device in Microsoft Entra ID after OAuth authentication with authorization code grant. Adversaries may use OAuth phishing techniques to obtain an OAuth authorization code, which can then be exchanged for access and refresh tokens. This rule detects a sequence of events where a user principal authenticates via OAuth, followed by a device registration event, indicating potential misuse of the OAuth flow to establish persistence or access resources.",

This can be done through the Azure portal by navigating to the user's account and invalidating all active sessions.\n- Enforce a password reset for the affected user accounts to ensure that any credentials potentially compromised during the attack are no longer valid.\n- Implement additional Conditional Access policies that require device compliance checks and restrict access to trusted locations or devices only, to mitigate the risk of future PRT abuse.\n- Conduct a thorough review of the affected accounts' recent activity logs to identify any unauthorized actions or data access that may have occurred during the compromise.\n- Escalate the incident to the security operations team for further investigation and to determine if there are any broader implications or additional compromised accounts.\n- Enhance monitoring by configuring alerts for unusual sign-in patterns or device code authentication attempts from unexpected locations or devices, to improve early detection of similar threats.\n- Coordinate with the incident response team to perform a post-incident analysis and update the incident response plan with lessons learned from this event.",
