This combination may indicate malicious execution, resource abuse, or\npost-compromise activity.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n- Review the correlated alert(s) to understand why the process was flagged by Elastic Defend.\n- Examine the process name, command line, and SHA-256 hash to determine whether the process is expected or known to be malicious.\n- Validate the observed CPU usage and duration to determine whether the spike is abnormal for this process and host.\n- Check for related process activity such as parent/child processes, suspicious process spawning, or privilege escalation attempts.\n- Review additional host telemetry including:\n  - Network connections initiated by the process\n  - File creation or modification events\n  - Persistence mechanisms (services, scheduled tasks, registry keys)\n- Determine whether similar activity is observed on other hosts, which may indicate a broader compromise.\n\n### False positive analysis\n- Legitimate high-CPU processes such as software updates, backup agents, security scans, or system maintenance tasks.\n- Resource-intensive but benign applications (e.g., compilers, video encoding, data processing jobs).\n- Security tools or monitoring agents temporarily consuming high CPU.\n\n### Response and remediation\n- If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate the affected host to prevent further impact.\n- Terminate the offending process if safe to do so.\n- Remove any identified malicious binaries or artifacts and eliminate persistence mechanisms.\n- Apply relevant patches or configuration changes to remediate the root cause.\n- Monitor the environment for recurrence of similar high-CPU processes combined with security alerts.\n- Escalate the incident if multiple hosts or indicators suggest coordinated or widespread activity.",
