The 'Behavior - Detected - CrowdStrike Alerts' rule captures security alerts generated by Falcon and enables analysts to investigate threats rapidly based on behavioral indicators and threat intelligence.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the associated process, file path, and command line to determine whether the activity is legitimate or suspicious.\n- Investigate the user account and host involved in the alert to validate whether the activity was authorized.\n- Cross-reference the alert with CrowdStrike Falcon console for additional context, including process tree, behavioral tags, and threat intelligence matches.\n- Check for any related alerts from the same host, user, or file hash to identify whether this is part of a larger attack chain.\n- Consult the Crowdstrike investigation guide and resources tagged in the alert for specific guidance on handling similar threats.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Alerts involving known and trusted software tools (e.g., remote administration tools) may be false positives. Confirm intent before excluding.\n- Security assessments or penetration testing activities might mimic real threats. Validate the activity with responsible teams.\n- Scheduled jobs, IT scripts, or automation tools may trigger alerts if they behave similarly to malicious code.\n- Review alerts based on detection confidence levels and behavioral scoring to filter out low-confidence or known-benign triggers.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Isolate affected endpoints to prevent lateral movement if malicious behavior is confirmed.\n- Quarantine any identified malicious files and block related hashes or domains.\n- Investigate how the threat entered the environment and close any exploited vulnerabilities.\n- Reset credentials for compromised user accounts or escalate to incident response.\n- Review CrowdStrike Falcon policies and detections to fine-tune future alerting and response coverage.\n- Document the findings and update detection logic or exceptions accordingly.\n",

To avoid this, disable the External Alerts rule when using this one.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nFor information on troubleshooting the maximum alerts warning please refer to this [guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts).\n",
