        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating Azure Entra MFA TOTP Brute Force Attempts\n\nThis rule detects high-frequency failed TOTP code attempts for a single user in a short time span. Such behavior could indicate an adversary attempting to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections using valid credentials. Understanding the context of the user's typical behavior and identifying anomalies in the log data are critical to determining the nature of the activity.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps:\n\n**Review the Source IP Address**:\n    - Check the `source.ip` or `azure.signinlogs.caller_ip_address` field.\n    - Determine if the IP address is associated with the user\u2019s typical login locations.\n    - Look for unusual geographic patterns or anomalous IP addresses (e.g., proxies, VPNs, or locations outside the user\u2019s normal activity).\n\n**Analyze User Activity**:\n    - Identify the user from the `azure.signinlogs.properties.sign_in_identifier` field.\n    - Determine if the user is currently active from another device or session. Session hijacking could explain parallel activity with failed attempts.\n    - Review past logs for the user to determine whether MFA failures or other anomalies are consistent or new.\n\n**Inspect the Authentication Method**:\n    - Evaluate the `azure.signinlogs.properties.mfa_detail.auth_method` field: `OATH verification code`.\n    - Confirm if the user typically uses TOTP codes or another MFA method (e.g., push notifications).\n    - Verify if there are any recent changes to the user\u2019s MFA settings that may explain multiple failed attempts.\n\n**Evaluate the User Agent**:\n    - Check the `user_agent.original` field.\n    - Identify if the user agent matches a typical browser or a potentially malicious script (e.g., Python-based).\n    - Look for deviations in operating system or browser versions from the user\u2019s normal activity.\n\n**Analyze Conditional Access Policies**:\n    - Review the `azure.signinlogs.properties.applied_conditional_access_policies` for enforced grant controls.\n    - Verify if MFA failures are tied to legitimate security policies (`display_name: Require multifactor authentication for admins`).\n\n**Correlate with Other Events**:\n    - Search for other authentication attempts involving the same `azure.signinlogs.caller_ip_address`, `user_principal_name`, or `azure.signinlogs.properties.app_id`.\n    - Look for suspicious activity patterns, such as password resets, privilege escalation, or account lockouts.\n\n\n#### False Positive Analysis:\n\n- **Unintentional User Behavior**:\n    - Verify if the failed attempts could result from the user\u2019s unfamiliarity with TOTP codes or issues with device synchronization.\n    - Check if the user recently switched MFA methods or devices, which could explain multiple failures.\n    - Determine if this is whitebox testing or a developer testing MFA integration.\n\n- **Administrative Actions**:\n    - Determine if the activity is related to legitimate administrative testing or configuration changes in the MFA system.\n\n#### Response and Remediation:\n\n- **Immediate Actions**:\n    - If proven malicious, lock the affected account temporarily to prevent further unauthorized attempts.\n    - Notify the user of suspicious activity and validate their access to the account.\n    - Reset passwords and MFA settings for the affected user to prevent unauthorized access while communicating with the user.\n\n- **Strengthen Authentication Policies**:\n    - Ensure conditional access policies are configured to monitor and restrict anomalous login behavior.\n    - Consider a different MFA method or additional security controls to prevent future bypass attempts.\n\n- **Monitor and Audit**:\n    - Implement additional monitoring to track high-frequency authentication failures across the environment.\n    - Audit historical logs for similar patterns involving other accounts to identify broader threats.\n\n- **Educate and Train Users**:\n    - Provide guidance on the secure use of MFA and the importance of recognizing and reporting suspicious activity.\n",
