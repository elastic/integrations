        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Microsoft Entra ID SharePoint Access for User Principal via Auth Broker\n\nThis rule identifies non-interactive sign-ins to SharePoint Online via the Microsoft Authentication Broker application using a refresh token or Primary Refresh Token (PRT). This type of activity may indicate token replay attacks, OAuth abuse, or automated access from previously consented apps or stolen sessions.\n\nThis is a [New Terms rule](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) that detects the first occurrence of a user principal name accessing SharePoint Online via the Microsoft Authentication Broker application in the last 14 days.\n\n### Possible Investigation Steps:\n\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.user_principal_name`: Identify the user involved. Investigate whether this user typically accesses SharePoint or if this is an anomaly.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.app_display_name`: Verify the application used (e.g., Authentication Broker). Determine if the app is expected for SharePoint access in your environment.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.resource_display_name`: Review the resource being accessed. SharePoint activity should be aligned with job roles or historical usage.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.incoming_token_type`: Indicates the token type used. Look for `refreshToken` or `primaryRefreshToken`, which may point to token replay or silent access.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.is_interactive`: If false, indicates the sign-in was non-interactive. Correlate with recent sign-ins to understand if a prior session may have been reused.\n- `user_agent.original`: Analyze the user agent string for automation indicators (e.g., scripts, unusual clients). Compare with what\u2019s typical for the user or device.\n- `source.ip`: Check the originating IP address. Investigate if the IP is associated with data centers, VPNs, anonymizers, or is geographically unusual for the user.\n- `source.geo.*`: Evaluate sign-in location details. Determine if the sign-in location aligns with expected travel or usage behavior.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.applied_conditional_access_policies`: Review whether Conditional Access policies were triggered or bypassed. Investigate if required controls (like MFA) were applied.\n- `azure.signinlogs.properties.authentication_processing_details`: Review any details about the authentication, such as token type or scopes. This may indicate delegated access or automation patterns.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- Certain MDM or mobile app scenarios may use refresh tokens legitimately via brokered apps.\n- Automated processes using authorized, scripted clients could trigger this activity, especially in developer or operations environments.\n- If Conditional Access policies are configured in \u201creport-only\u201d mode or exempted for trusted apps, activity may appear unusual but be authorized.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- If activity appears unauthorized:\n  - Investigate and revoke active sessions or refresh tokens.\n  - Notify the user and validate expected activity.\n  - Review and audit app consent permissions and remove unused or high-risk delegated access.\n- Harden Conditional Access policies to limit non-interactive access to sensitive resources.\n- Monitor for repeated use of the same user agent, IP, or token type across other users to identify broader campaigns.\n- Consider alerting on unusual patterns in sign-in frequency, geography, and application usage for SharePoint and other key services.\n\n",
