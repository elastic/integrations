        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Sensitive IAM Operations Performed via CloudShell\n\nAWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell environment that provides instant command-line access to AWS resources without requiring local CLI installation or credential configuration. While this is convenient for legitimate administrators, it also provides adversaries with a powerful tool if they gain access to a compromised AWS console session. Attackers can use CloudShell to perform sensitive operations without leaving artifacts on their local systems.\n\nThis rule detects high-risk IAM operations performed via CloudShell, including credential creation, user management, and policy attachment. These actions are commonly seen in post-compromise scenarios where attackers establish persistence or escalate privileges.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor**\n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to determine which IAM principal performed the action.\n  - Check `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to verify the request origin matches expected administrator locations.\n  - Investigate the console login event that established the CloudShell session.\n\n- **Analyze the specific action**\n  - Review `event.action` to understand exactly what operation was performed.\n  - For `CreateAccessKey` or `CreateUser`, identify the target principal and assess whether this was authorized.\n  - For policy attachments, review which policies were attached and to which entities.\n\n- **Review request and response details**\n  - Examine `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` for specifics like user names, policy ARNs, or role configurations.\n  - Check `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements` for created resource identifiers.\n\n- **Correlate with surrounding activity**\n  - Search for preceding events such as `ConsoleLogin` from the same session or IP address.\n  - Look for MFA bypass indicators or unusual login patterns before CloudShell usage.\n  - Check for subsequent use of any created credentials or roles.\n\n- **Assess the broader context**\n  - Determine if this CloudShell usage pattern is typical for this user.\n  - Review recent access patterns for the console session that initiated CloudShell.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Routine administrative tasks using CloudShell are common in some organizations. Create baseline profiles for users who regularly use CloudShell.\n- Infrastructure automation testing may involve CloudShell for quick validation. Verify with the user.\n\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If unauthorized, immediately terminate the console session and revoke any created credentials.\n- Rotate credentials for any IAM users or roles that may have been compromised.\n- Review and remove any unauthorized users, access keys, roles, or policy attachments.\n- Consider restricting CloudShell access via SCPs or IAM policies for sensitive accounts.\n- Implement session duration limits to reduce the window of opportunity for console session abuse.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)**\n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n",
