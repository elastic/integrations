        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS EC2 Route Table Modified or Deleted\n\nThis rule detects modifications or deletions of AWS route tables using actions such as `ReplaceRoute`, `ReplaceRouteTableAssociation`, `DeleteRouteTable`, `DeleteRoute`, or `DisassociateRouteTable`. These actions may indicate legitimate administrative activity, but they can also be abused by attackers to disrupt network traffic, reroute communications, or maintain persistence in a compromised environment.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Review Request Parameters:**\n   - Check the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` field. The sub-fields may vary depending on the `event.action` (e.g., `routeTableId` for `DeleteRouteTable`, `destinationCidrBlock` for `ReplaceRoute`).\n   - Validate the affected route table, routes, or associations based on the API call:\n     - For `ReplaceRoute`: Look for changes in specific routes using `destinationCidrBlock`.\n     - For `ReplaceRouteTableAssociation`: Review the new association details (e.g., subnet ID).\n     - For `DeleteRouteTable`: Confirm the `routeTableId` of the deleted table.\n     - For `DisassociateRouteTable`: Verify the disassociated resources.\n\n- **Review User Context**:\n  - **User Identity**: Inspect the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field to determine the user or role initiating the action. Investigate whether this user is authorized to perform these operations.\n  - **Access Key ID**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field to identify if the access key used was expected or potentially compromised.\n  - **Access Patterns**: Validate whether the user or role has a history of performing route table modifications and whether this aligns with their expected responsibilities.\n\n- **Analyze Request Details**:\n  - **Action Type**: Verify the specific API call in the `event.action` field (e.g., `ReplaceRoute`, `DeleteRouteTable`) to understand the nature of the modification.\n  - **Source IP and Geolocation**: Examine the `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to confirm whether the request originated from a trusted location. Suspicious geolocations or IPs may indicate adversarial activity.\n  - **User Agent**: Review the `user_agent.original` field to determine the tool used for the request (e.g., AWS CLI, Terraform). Unusual or custom user agents may indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Correlate with Other Activity**:\n  - **Concurrent API Calls**: Look for related API calls (e.g., `CreateRoute`, `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`, or `ModifyInstanceAttribute`) from the same user or IP to detect broader attack patterns.\n  - **IAM Changes**: Investigate whether any IAM policy updates or privilege escalation attempts preceded this activity.\n  - **Unusual Volume of Changes**: Check if the user has performed multiple route table modifications or deletions in a short timeframe.\n\n- **Validate the Intent**:\n  - **Planned Changes**: Confirm with administrators whether the route table changes were part of a planned update or maintenance activity.\n  - **Permissions and Justification**: Ensure that the user or role has the least privilege necessary for these actions and that there is a valid reason for modifying the route table.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Routine Administration**: Route table modifications are often part of routine administrative tasks, such as creating new routes, updating associations, or removing unused resources.\n- **Automation Tools**: Automated workflows, such as those executed by Terraform or CloudFormation, may trigger these events. Verify whether the `user_agent.original` field or source IP matches known automation tools.\n- **Maintenance or Scaling**: Confirm whether these actions align with maintenance activities or scaling events (e.g., adding or removing subnets).\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Revoke Unauthorized Permissions**: If unauthorized, remove permissions for related actions from the user or role. You can use the managed [AWSDenyAll](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSDenyAll.html) policy.\n- **Restore the Route Table**:\n  - If critical networking was impacted, restore the route table or reapply previous configurations from backups or Terraform state files.\n  - Verify connectivity to affected subnets or instances to ensure no disruptions to services.\n- **Audit IAM Policies**:\n  - Limit route table modification permissions to specific trusted users, roles, or automation accounts.\n  - Implement conditions in IAM policies, such as source IP restrictions, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.\n- **Monitor and Alert**:\n  - Set up additional alerts for unexpected route table modifications or deletions.\n  - Use VPC flow logs and CloudTrail to monitor for related suspicious activity.\n- **Secure Automation**: Ensure automation tools, such as Terraform or CloudFormation, are configured securely and that their credentials are stored in secure locations like AWS Secrets Manager.\n",
