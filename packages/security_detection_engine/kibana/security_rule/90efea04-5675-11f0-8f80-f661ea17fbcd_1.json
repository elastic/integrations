        "description": "Detects a sequence of events in Microsoft Entra ID indicative of a suspicious cloud-based device registration, potentially using ROADtools. This behavior involves adding a device via the Device Registration Service, followed by the assignment of registered users and owners \u2014 a pattern consistent with techniques used to establish persistence or acquire a Primary Refresh Token (PRT). ROADtools, a popular red team toolkit, often leaves distinct telemetry signatures such as the `Microsoft.OData.Client` user agent and specific OS version values. These sequences are uncommon in typical user behavior and may reflect abuse of device trust for session hijacking or silent token replay.",

        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Microsoft Entra ID Suspicious Cloud Device Registration\n\nThis rule detects a sequence of Microsoft Entra ID audit events consistent with cloud device registration abuse via ROADtools or similar automation. The activity includes three correlated events:\n\n1. Add device operation from the Device Registration Service using a `Microsoft.OData.Client/*` user-agent and a known Windows OS version.\n2. Addition of a registered user with an `enterprise registration` URN.\n3. Assignment of a registered owner to the device.\n\nThis pattern has been observed in OAuth phishing and PRT abuse campaigns where adversaries silently register a cloud device to obtain persistent, trusted access.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Identify the user principal associated with the device registration.\n- Review the `azure.auditlogs.identity` field to confirm the Device Registration Service initiated the request.\n- Check for the presence of the `Microsoft.OData.Client/*` user-agent in `azure.auditlogs.properties.additional_details.value`, as this is common in ROADtools usage.\n- Confirm the OS version seen in the modified properties is expected (e.g., `10.0.19041.928`), or investigate unexpected versions.\n- Examine the URN in the new value field (`urn:ms-drs:enterpriseregistration.windows.net`) to verify it's not being misused.\n- Use `azure.correlation_id` to pivot across all three steps of the registration flow.\n- Pivot to `azure.signinlogs` to detect follow-on activity using the new device, such as sign-ins involving refresh or primary refresh tokens.\n- Look for signs of persistence or lateral movement enabled by the newly registered device.\n- Identify the registered device name by reviewing `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.0.display_name` and confirm it's expected for the user or organization.\n- Use the correlation ID `azure.correlation_id` to pivot into registered user events from Entra ID audit logs and check `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.0.user_principal_name` to identify the user associated with the device registration.\n- Review any activity for this user from Entra ID sign-in logs, where the incoming token type is a `primaryRefreshToken`.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Some MDM or autopilot provisioning flows may generate similar sequences. Validate against known provisioning tools, expected rollout windows, and device inventory.\n- Investigate whether the device name, OS version, and registration details align with normal IT workflows.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- If confirmed malicious, remove the registered device from Entra ID.\n- Revoke refresh tokens and primary refresh tokens associated with the user and device.\n- Disable the user account and initiate password reset and identity verification procedures.\n- Review audit logs and sign-in activity for additional indicators of persistence or access from the rogue device.\n- Tighten conditional access policies to restrict device registration and enforce compliance or hybrid join requirements.\n",
