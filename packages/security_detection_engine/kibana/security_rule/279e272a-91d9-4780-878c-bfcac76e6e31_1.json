While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Suspicious Interactive Process Execution Detected via Defend for Containers\n\nThis alert flags an interactive program launched inside a container from transient or low-trust locations such as tmpfs-backed or runtime directories, common staging points for hands-on misuse, data theft, or persistence that avoids the image filesystem. A frequent pattern is an attacker gaining a shell via kubectl exec, fetching a static reverse shell or tunneling tool into /dev/shm or /tmp, and running it interactively to pivot or siphon data. Such behavior signals live operator control and attempts to evade forensics and policy controls.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Pivot to Kubernetes API server audit logs to find pod/exec or attach events around the alert and map them to the initiating user, source IP, and service account.\n- Determine if the binary or script was introduced post-deploy by listing transient directories in the container and comparing artifacts against the image layers or build manifest.\n- Review process lineage and TTY/PTY session details to confirm an interactive shell and identify the parent or invocation method, such as a shell or reverse-shell stager.\n- Capture live network activity from the container to spot external callbacks, tunnels, or exfil destinations, and isolate the pod if suspicious connections are present.\n- Assess the pod\u2019s service account, RBAC permissions, and security context for elevated privileges or host namespace access to gauge impact and prioritize containment.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- An engineer performing authorized troubleshooting opens an interactive shell and runs a known diagnostic binary staged in /tmp or /dev/shm to avoid altering the image, leading to an interactive exec from a transient path.\n- A mounted volume under /mnt or /media holds legitimate utilities, and an authorized user starts one interactively for maintenance or configuration, triggering the rule despite expected operations.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Immediately contain by applying a deny-all egress NetworkPolicy to the affected pod, killing the interactive process whose executable resides under /tmp, /dev/shm, /var/tmp, /run, /var/run, /mnt, /media, or /boot, and blocking further kubectl exec/attach to it.\n- Eradicate by terminating and redeploying the pod from a trusted image, scanning and cleaning any mounted volumes under /mnt or /media, and removing staged binaries or scripts found in transient paths like /tmp, /var/tmp, /run, and /var/run.\n- Recover by rotating credentials the pod could access (service account token, mounted secrets, API keys), validating application behavior post-redeploy, and restoring network access only to approved destinations.\n- Escalate to incident response immediately if you observe a shell or tunneling tool launched from /tmp or /dev/shm, evidence of exfiltration via outbound connections, privileged or hostPID/hostNetwork settings, or writes touching /boot.\n- Harden by disabling kubectl exec for production workloads, enforcing readOnlyRootFilesystem with seccomp and AppArmor, mounting /tmp and /dev/shm with noexec,nodev,nosuid, and using admission policy to allowlist executable paths and deny interactive TTYs.",
