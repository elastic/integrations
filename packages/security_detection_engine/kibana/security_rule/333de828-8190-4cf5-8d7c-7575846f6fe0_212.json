While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating AWS IAM User Addition to Group\n\nThis rule detects when an IAM user is added to an IAM group via the `AddUserToGroup` API call. If the target group holds elevated privileges, this action may immediately grant that user wide-ranging access useful for credential misuse or lateral movement. This rule helps detect unauthorized privilege escalation via group membership change. Treat as high-risk when the destination group has wide scope (e.g., AdministratorAccess or permissive inline policies).\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor and target**  \n  - Check `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` for who added the user.  \n  - From `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters`, capture `userName` (added user) and `groupName` (destination group).  \n  - Check `source.ip`, `user_agent.original`, `cloud.region` for unusual patterns.\n\n- **Examine the group\u2019s privileges**  \n  - Use `GetGroup`, `ListAttachedGroupPolicies` to see what policies the group holds. Look for `AdministratorAccess`, `iam:*`, `s3:*`, `ec2:*` or cross-account permissions.  \n  - Check whether the group was recently created (`CreateGroup`) or recently escalated (`AttachGroupPolicy`). Common attacker pattern: create > attach policy > add user.\n\n- **Correlate with surrounding activity**  \n  - Look for preceding events by the actor: `AssumeRole`, `GetSessionToken`, `CreateAccessKey`, `AttachGroupPolicy`.  \n  - Follow the added user\u2019s activities after group membership. Look for sensitive operations (e.g., IAM actions, S3 policy changes, EC2 snapshot/AMI activity).\n\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Onboarding or role transitions may legitimately add users to groups.  \n- Automated Identity-Management pipelines may add many users to service groups; validate know\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Containment**:\n  - If unapproved, remove the user from the group immediately (`RemoveUserFromGroup`) and rotate their access keys.\n  - Temporarily restrict group policy changes while assessing blast radius.\n- **Investigation and scoping**:\n  - Review all actions executed by the newly added user since the change (ex: PutBucketPolicy, CreateAccessKey, PassRole).\n  - Confirm whether other users were added to the same group within the same window. \n- **Recovery and hardening**: \n  - Enforce least privilege by redesigning large-group membership. \n  - Restrict `iam:AddUserToGroup` to only appropriate service principals with approval workflow. \n  - Create detections for AttachGroupPolicy to powerful policies and for mass AddUserToGroup patterns.\n\n### Additional information\n[AWS Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/)\n",
