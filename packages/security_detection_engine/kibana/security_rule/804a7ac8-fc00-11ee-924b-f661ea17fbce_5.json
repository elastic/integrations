Verify with the respective teams or personnel.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Incident Response Activation**: If malicious intent or actions are confirmed, activate the incident response protocol.\n    - This includes containment of the threat, eradication of the adversary\u2019s presence, recovery of affected systems, and a thorough investigation.\n- **Validate and Reinforce Security Policies**: Ensure that policies around SSM session initiation are strict and adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n    - Update IAM policies if necessary to tighten controls.\n- **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**: Improve monitoring of SSM sessions, particularly focusing on sessions that involve sensitive or critical EC2 instances.\n    - Adjust alerting mechanisms to flag unusual session initiations promptly.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor more in-depth understanding of managing SSM sessions and security best practices, refer to the [AWS Systems Manager documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_StartSession.html). Additionally, consider the security implications and best practices outlined in [AWS SSM privilege escalation techniques](https://cloud.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-cloud/aws-security/aws-privilege-escalation/aws-ssm-privesc).\n\n",
