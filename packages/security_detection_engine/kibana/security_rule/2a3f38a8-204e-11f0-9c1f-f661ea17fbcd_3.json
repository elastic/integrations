        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating Microsoft Graph First Occurrence of Client Request\n\nThis rule detects the first observed occurrence of a Microsoft Graph API request by a specific client application ID (`azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.app_id`) in combination with a user principal object ID (`azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.user_principal_object_id`) and tenant ID (`azure.tenant_id`) within the last 14 days. This may indicate unauthorized access following a successful phishing attempt, token theft, or abuse of OAuth workflows.\n\nAdversaries frequently exploit legitimate Microsoft or third-party application IDs to avoid raising suspicion during initial access. By using pre-consented or trusted apps to interact with Microsoft Graph, attackers can perform actions on behalf of users without triggering conventional authentication alerts or requiring additional user interaction.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review `azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.user_principal_object_id` and correlate with recent sign-in logs for the associated user.\n- Determine whether `azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.app_id` is a known and approved application in your environment.\n- Investigate the `user_agent.original` field for signs of scripted access (e.g., automation tools or libraries).\n- Check the source IP address (`source.ip`) and geolocation data (`source.geo.*`) for unfamiliar origins.\n- Inspect `azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.scopes` to understand the level of access being requested by the app.\n- Examine any follow-up Graph API activity from the same `app_id` or `user_principal_object_id` for signs of data access or exfiltration.\n- Correlate with device or session ID fields (`azure.graphactivitylogs.properties.c_sid`, if present) to detect persistent or repeat activity.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- First-time use of a legitimate Microsoft or enterprise-approved application.\n- Developer or automation workflows initiating new Graph API requests.\n- Valid end-user activity following device reconfiguration or new client installation.\n- Maintain an allowlist of expected `app_id` values and known developer tools.\n- Suppress detections from known good `user_agent.original` strings or approved source IP ranges.\n- Use device and identity telemetry to distinguish trusted vs. unknown activity sources.\n- Combine with session risk or sign-in anomaly signals where available.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Reach out to the user and verify whether they authorized the application access.\n- Revoke active OAuth tokens and reset credentials if unauthorized use is confirmed.\n- Search for additional Graph API calls made by the same `app_id` or `user_principal_object_id`.\n- Investigate whether sensitive resources (mail, files, Teams, contacts) were accessed.\n- Apply Conditional Access policies to limit Graph API access by app type, IP, or device state.\n- Restrict user consent for third-party apps and enforce admin approval workflows.\n- Monitor usage of new or uncommon `app_id` values across your tenant.\n- Provide user education on OAuth phishing tactics and reporting suspicious prompts.\n",
