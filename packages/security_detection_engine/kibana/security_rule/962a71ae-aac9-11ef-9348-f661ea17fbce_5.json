        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n> **Disclaimer**:\n> This investigation guide was created using generative AI technology and has been reviewed to improve its accuracy and relevance. \n> While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, validate and adapt it to suit your operational needs.\n\n### Investigating AWS STS AssumeRoot by Rare User and Member Account\n\nAWS STS `AssumeRoot` issues temporary credentials that grant elevated access into a member account, constrained by the\ntask policy and target policy attached to the request. In normal operations, only a small set of platform, security, or\nautomation roles should ever need to perform `AssumeRoot`, and typically only against a predictable set of member\naccounts.\n\nThis rule is a New Terms rule that detects when a previously unseen combination of calling principal (`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn`) and target member account (`aws.cloudtrail.resources.account_id`) successfully invokes `AssumeRoot`. Activity that matches this pattern may indicate privilege escalation, lateral movement into a new account, abuse of cross-account access paths, or misuse of administrative workflows.\n\n#### Possible investigation steps\n\n- **Identify the actor and target context**\n  - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to determine:\n    - Whether the caller is an IAM user, federated user, or role.\n    - Whether this identity is normally used for organization-level administration or automation.\n  - Inspect `aws.cloudtrail.resources.account_id` and `aws.cloudtrail.recipient_account_id` to identify the affected member account.\n  - Check `source.address`, `source.geo.*`, and `user_agent.original` to understand where and how the call was made (console, CLI, SDK, automation runner, VPN, corporate IP, etc.).\n\n- **Understand session, policy, and target details**\n  - Examine `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` for:\n    - `taskPolicyArn` \u2013 which predefined task policy was requested and what category of operations it enables (e.g., investigation, remediation, read-only, or broad admin).\n    - `targetPrincipal` and/or related target fields \u2013 which member account principal is being accessed.\n    - Any duration or configuration parameters (such as `durationSeconds`) that indicate unusually long-lived sessions.\n  - In `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements`, review:\n    - `credentials.accessKeyId` and `credentials.expiration` to confirm that credentials were successfully issued and how long they are valid.\n    - Any additional response fields that indicate session constraints or failures (if present).\n\n- **Correlate follow-on activity from the assumed root session**\n  - Use the temporary access key from `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements.credentials.accessKeyId` to pivot in CloudTrail:\n    - Search for subsequent events where `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` matches that key.\n    - Look for high-impact actions such as:\n      - IAM changes (`iam:CreateUser`, `iam:AttachRolePolicy`, `iam:PutRolePolicy`, `iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`).\n      - Guardrail changes (CloudTrail, Security Hub, Config, GuardDuty configuration or detector changes).\n      - Data-impacting actions (S3 bucket policy changes, RDS/RDS snapshot operations, EFS/RDS delete, secrets reads).\n  - Correlate with any prior events for the calling identity:\n    - STS calls that created the session used to invoke `AssumeRoot` (e.g., `AssumeRole`, SSO/identity provider activity).\n    - Recent IAM policy updates that broadened its ability to perform cross-account administration.\n\n- **Assess timing and operational alignment**\n  - Use `@timestamp`, `cloud.region`, and your change calendar to determine:\n    - Whether the event occurred during a documented maintenance window or deployment.\n    - Whether the region and account align with the caller\u2019s normal operational scope.\n  - Compare with other events in the same time window:\n    - Organization-level changes, new account creation, or migration work.\n    - Other sensitive operations from the same `source.ip` or principal.\n\n- **Validate with owners**\n  - Confirm with:\n    - Cloud/infra platform teams that normally operate organization-level admin roles.\n    - Security/IR teams if they were running an investigation workflow that legitimately uses `AssumeRoot`.\n  - Check whether the use of `AssumeRoot` is documented in CI/CD or automation designs that might have just expanded to this account, explaining the New Terms trigger.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Legitimate administrative cross-account access**\n  - Platform, security, or central operations teams may use `AssumeRoot` as part of sanctioned workflows for:\n    - New account onboarding.\n    - Centralized remediation or investigation.\n    - Complex deployment or migration tasks.\n  - If this is the first time a specific engineer or automation role is onboarded to a given member account, the rule will fire once because it is a New Terms rule. Validate and, if appropriate, document this as expected behavior.\n\n- **Automation and scheduled workflows**\n  - CI/CD pipelines, organization-wide maintenance jobs, or incident response automation may use `AssumeRoot`:\n    - Identify automation roles and service principals that legitimately call `AssumeRoot`.\n    - Tune with rule exceptions based on `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn`, `user_agent.original`, or specific `taskPolicyArn` values used only by trusted workflows.\n\nIf a pattern emerges where specific roles regularly and legitimately assume root into a consistent set of accounts, consider documenting those identities and, if appropriate, creating narrow exceptions \u2014 while preserving coverage for new, unexpected combinations.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Contain potentially unauthorized sessions**\n  - If the activity appears suspicious or unapproved:\n    - Invalidate the credentials issued by `AssumeRoot` (where supported) or constrain their impact by immediately tightening IAM, SCPs, or network controls in the affected member account.\n    - Rotate or revoke long-lived access keys associated with the calling principal.\n    - Temporarily restrict permissions on roles allowed to call `AssumeRoot` until the investigation is complete.\n\n- **Investigate scope and impact**\n  - Using CloudTrail:\n    - Enumerate all actions performed with the `AssumeRoot` session access key and identify:\n      - Privilege changes (IAM users, roles, policies, permission boundaries, SCPs).\n      - Changes to logging and security controls (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config, firewall/WAF rules).\n      - Data-impacting operations on high-value services (S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, KMS).\n    - Check if similar `AssumeRoot` activity has occurred recently from the same `source.ip`, principal, or member account.\n  - Engage application, data, and platform owners for the impacted account(s) to:\n    - Assess potential data exposure, integrity issues, or downtime.\n    - Determine whether any actions conflict with intended change plans.\n\n- **Hardening and preventive controls**\n  - Restrict and monitor `AssumeRoot` usage:\n    - Limit which IAM roles and identities can call `sts:AssumeRoot`, using IAM conditions (e.g., `aws:PrincipalArn`, `aws:PrincipalOrgID`, `aws:RequestedRegion`).\n    - Where possible, require strong authentication on the initiating principal (MFA, federated SSO, device posture).\n  - Add guardrails and observability:\n    - Use AWS Config, Security Hub, and/or AWS Organizations SCPs to:\n      - Detect or constrain highly privileged cross-account actions.\n      - Ensure logging and monitoring services cannot be disabled or modified by assumed sessions without additional friction.\n    - Ensure `AssumeRoot` activity is included in your SIEM dashboards and investigation playbooks.\n\n- **Post-incident improvements**\n  - If activity is confirmed malicious or unsafe:\n    - Rotate credentials for all involved principals and review recent STS session usage for anomalies.\n    - Update internal runbooks to clearly define when `AssumeRoot` is allowed, who can perform it, and how it should be documented.\n    - Refine this rule\u2019s exceptions or tagging strategy so that legitimate, recurring workflows are well-understood, while preserving high-fidelity visibility into new or unexpected `AssumeRoot` behavior.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **Security Best Practices:** [AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/).\n",
