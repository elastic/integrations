        "note": " Triage and analysis\n\n## Investigating Microsoft Sentinel External Alerts\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM tool that aggregates security data for threat detection and response. The rule identifies each alert logged in Sentinel, enabling analysts to swiftly investigate potential threats.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the timeline of events leading up to the alert to identify any unusual or suspicious activities that may have occurred.\n- Cross-reference the alert with other related alerts or logs in Microsoft Sentinel to determine if this is part of a larger pattern or isolated incident.\n- Investigate the source and context of the alert to identify any patterns or anomalies that could indicate manipulation or false positives.\n- Consult the Microsoft Sentinel investigation guide and resources tagged in the alert for specific guidance on handling similar threats.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Alerts triggered by routine administrative tasks can be false positives. Identify these tasks and create exceptions to prevent unnecessary alerts.\n- Frequent alerts from known safe IP addresses or domains may not indicate a threat. Whitelist these sources to reduce noise.\n- Alerts generated by automated scripts or scheduled tasks that are part of regular operations can be excluded by setting up filters for these specific activities.\n- Non-threatening alerts from internal network scans or vulnerability assessments should be reviewed and excluded if they are part of regular security practices.\n- Alerts from test environments or sandboxed systems can be false positives. Exclude these environments from alert generation to focus on genuine threats.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Contain the threat by isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.\n- Review and terminate any suspicious processes or sessions identified in the alert to halt ongoing malicious activities.\n- Conduct a thorough analysis of the alert details to identify any compromised accounts or credentials and reset passwords immediately.\n- Apply relevant security patches or updates to affected systems to close any vulnerabilities exploited by the adversary.\n- Restore affected systems from clean backups to ensure the integrity and security of the environment.\n- Monitor network traffic and system logs closely for any signs of recurring or related suspicious activities.\n- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional resources are needed.\n",

Consider adding a rule exception for the External Alert rule to exclude data_stream.dataset:microsoft_sentinel.alert to avoid receiving duplicate alerts.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nFor information on troubleshooting the maximum alerts warning please refer to this [guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts).\n",
