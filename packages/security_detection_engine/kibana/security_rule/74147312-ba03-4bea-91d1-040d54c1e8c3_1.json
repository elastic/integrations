        "note": " Triage and analysis\n\n## Investigating Microsoft Sentinel External Alerts\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM tool that aggregates security data for threat detection and response. The 'Behavior - Detected' rule identifies each alert logged in Sentinel, enabling analysts to swiftly investigate potential threats.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Examine the timeline of events leading up to the alert to identify any unusual or suspicious activities that may have occurred.\n- Cross-reference the alert with other related alerts or logs in Microsoft Sentinel to determine if this is part of a larger pattern or isolated incident.\n- Investigate the source and context of the alert to identify any patterns or anomalies that could indicate manipulation or false positives.\n- Consult the Microsoft Sentinel investigation guide and resources tagged in the alert for specific guidance on handling similar threats.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Alerts triggered by routine administrative tasks can be false positives. Identify these tasks and create exceptions to prevent unnecessary alerts.\n- Frequent alerts from known safe IP addresses or domains may not indicate a threat. Whitelist these sources to reduce noise.\n- Alerts generated by automated scripts or scheduled tasks that are part of regular operations can be excluded by setting up filters for these specific activities.\n- Non-threatening alerts from internal network scans or vulnerability assessments should be reviewed and excluded if they are part of regular security practices.\n- Alerts from test environments or sandboxed systems can be false positives. Exclude these environments from alert generation to focus on genuine threats.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Contain the threat by isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.\n- Review and terminate any suspicious processes or sessions identified in the alert to halt ongoing malicious activities.\n- Conduct a thorough analysis of the alert details to identify any compromised accounts or credentials and reset passwords immediately.\n- Apply relevant security patches or updates to affected systems to close any vulnerabilities exploited by the adversary.\n- Restore affected systems from clean backups to ensure the integrity and security of the environment.\n- Monitor network traffic and system logs closely for any signs of recurring or related suspicious activities.\n- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional resources are needed.\n",

To avoid this, disable the External Alerts rule when using this one.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nFor information on troubleshooting the maximum alerts warning please refer to this [guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts).\n",
