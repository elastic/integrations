While every effort has been made to ensure its quality, we recommend validating the content and adapting it to suit your specific environment and operational needs.\n\n### Investigating Suspected Lateral Movement from Compromised Host\n\nThe detection rule uses alert data to determine when multiple alerts from different integrations involving the same user.name are triggered.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the alert details to identify the specific host involved and the different modules and rules that triggered the alert.\n- Examine the timeline of the alerts to understand the sequence of events and determine if there is a pattern or progression in the tactics used.\n- Correlate the alert data with other logs and telemetry from the host, such as process creation, network connections, and file modifications, to gather additional context.\n- Investigate any known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on the host that could have been exploited by the adversary.\n- Check for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the alerts, such as suspicious IP addresses, domains, or file hashes, and search for these across the network.\n- Assess the impact and scope of the potential compromise by determining if other hosts or systems have similar alerts or related activity.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Vulnerability scanners.\n- Jump hosts, NAT gateways and proxies.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Isolate the affected host from the network immediately to prevent further lateral movement by the adversary.\n- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to identify the specific vulnerabilities exploited and gather evidence of the attack phases involved.\n- Remove any identified malicious software or unauthorized access tools from the host, ensuring all persistence mechanisms are eradicated.\n- Apply security patches and updates to the host to address any exploited vulnerabilities and prevent similar attacks.\n- Restore the host from a known good backup if necessary, ensuring that the backup is free from compromise.\n- Monitor the host and network for any signs of re-infection or further suspicious activity, using enhanced logging and alerting based on the identified attack patterns.\n- Escalate the incident to the appropriate internal or external cybersecurity teams for further investigation and potential legal action if the attack is part of a larger campaign.",
