        "note": "## Triage and analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS Config Resource Deletion\n\nAWS Config records configuration changes, relationships, and compliance status for AWS resources over time.\nDeleting Config components such as recorders, delivery channels, rules, or conformance packs disrupts\nsecurity monitoring, compliance enforcement, and forensic visibility. This behavior is uncommon outside of\nplanned infrastructure changes and should be treated as high-risk when unexpected. This rule detects successful deletion of AWS Config resources.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n**Identify the actor**\n- Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to determine who initiated the deletion.\n- Confirm whether this principal typically manages AWS Config or centralized security tooling.\n- Check `user_agent.original` to determine whether the action was performed via console, CLI, SDK, or automation.\n\n**Determine what was deleted**\n- Inspect `event.action` and `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` to identify which Config component was removed\n  (e.g., configuration recorder, delivery channel, rule, aggregator, or conformance pack).\n- Assess whether the deleted resource was account-scoped or organization-wide. Used for compliance reporting, guardrails, or security monitoring.\n- Identify the affected regions and accounts using `cloud.region` and `cloud.account.id`.\n\n**Reconstruct timing and intent**\n- Use `@timestamp` to correlate the deletion with:\n  - IAM changes (role updates, policy modifications, STS activity).\n  - Other monitoring disruptions (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub).\n  - Destructive or high-impact actions occurring shortly before or after.\n- Compare the timing against approved maintenance windows or infrastructure changes.\n\n**Correlate with broader activity**\n- Pivot in CloudTrail on the same principal or access key to identify:\n  - Additional attempts to disable logging or security controls.\n  - Resource deletions or configuration weakening across services.\n- Evaluate whether the deletion appears isolated or part of a broader evasion sequence.\n\n**Validate intent with stakeholders**\n- Confirm with security, cloud platform, or compliance teams whether the deletion was planned and approved.\n- Verify whether replacement Config resources were created shortly after, or whether monitoring remains disabled.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- **Planned environment changes**\n  - Non-production account teardown, environment consolidation, or compliance tool migrations may involve\n    deletion of Config resources.\n\n- **Authorized security automation**\n  - Approved automation or security tooling may delete and recreate Config components during setup or remediation.\n  - Tune exceptions carefully using specific principals or automation roles rather than broad exclusions.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- **Contain and restore visibility**\n  - If unauthorized, immediately re-enable AWS Config components, including recorders and delivery channels.\n  - Validate that historical configuration data and compliance reporting resume as expected.\n\n- **Investigate scope and impact**\n  - Determine how long Config visibility was impaired and what activity may have occurred during that window.\n  - Review other monitoring gaps (e.g., CloudTrail or GuardDuty changes) for coordinated evasion.\n\n- **Credential and access review**\n  - Rotate or disable credentials associated with the deleting principal if compromise is suspected.\n  - Review IAM permissions to ensure only a minimal, well-defined set of roles can manage AWS Config.\n\n- **Hardening and prevention**\n  - Use SCPs or IAM conditions to restrict deletion of Config resources in production and security accounts.\n  - Implement AWS Config rules or Security Hub controls to alert when Config is disabled or degraded.\n  - Document and formalize change procedures for governance tooling.\n\n### Additional information\n- **[AWS IR Playbooks](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-incident-response-playbooks/blob/c151b0dc091755fffd4d662a8f29e2f6794da52c/playbooks/)** \n- **[AWS Customer Playbook Framework](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-customer-playbook-framework/tree/a8c7b313636b406a375952ac00b2d68e89a991f2/docs)** \n- **[AWS Knowledge Center \u2013 Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/)**\n",
