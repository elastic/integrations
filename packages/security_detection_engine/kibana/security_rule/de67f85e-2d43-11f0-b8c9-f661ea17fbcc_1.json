        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating Multiple Microsoft 365 User Account Lockouts in Short Time Window\n\nDetects a burst of Microsoft 365 user account lockouts within a short 5-minute window. A high number of IdsLocked login errors across multiple user accounts may indicate brute-force attempts for the same users resulting in lockouts.\n\nThis rule uses ES|QL aggregations and thus has dynamically generated fields. Correlation of the values in the alert document may need to be performed to the original sign-in and Graph events for further context.\n\n### Investigation Steps\n\n- Review the `user_id_list`: Are specific naming patterns targeted (e.g., admin, helpdesk)?\n- Examine `ip_list` and `source_orgs`: Look for suspicious ISPs or hosting providers.\n- Check `duration_seconds`: A very short window with a high lockout rate often indicates automation.\n- Confirm lockout policy thresholds with IAM or Entra ID admins. Did the policy trigger correctly?\n- Use the `first_seen` and `last_seen` values to pivot into related authentication or audit logs.\n- Correlate with any recent detection of password spraying or credential stuffing activity.\n- Review the `request_type` field to identify which authentication methods were used (e.g., OAuth, SAML, etc.).\n- Check for any successful logins from the same IP or ASN after the lockouts.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- Automated systems with stale credentials may cause repeated failed logins.\n- Legitimate bulk provisioning or scripted tests could unintentionally cause account lockouts.\n- Red team exercises or penetration tests may resemble the same lockout pattern.\n- Some organizations may have a high volume of lockouts due to user behavior or legacy systems.\n\n### Response Recommendations\n\n- Notify affected users and confirm whether activity was expected or suspicious.\n- Lock or reset credentials for impacted accounts.\n- Block the source IP(s) or ASN temporarily using conditional access or firewall rules.\n- Strengthen lockout and retry delay policies if necessary.\n- Review the originating application(s) involved via `request_types`.\n",
