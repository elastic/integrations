        "description": "Identifies PowerShell scripts that use invalid escape sequences as a form of obfuscation. This technique introduces backticks (`) between characters in a way that does not correspond to valid PowerShell escape sequences, breaking up strings and bypassing pattern-based detections while preserving execution logic. This is designed to evade static analysis and bypass security protections such as the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI).",
