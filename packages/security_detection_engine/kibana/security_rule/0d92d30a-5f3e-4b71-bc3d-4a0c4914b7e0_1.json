Usage from multiple IP addresses may indicate the token was stolen and used elsewhere.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify the IAM User**: Examine `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and correlate with `source.ip` to determine how widely the token was used.\n- **Check Recent MFA Events**: Determine whether the user recently enabled MFA, registered devices, or assumed a role using this token.\n- **Review Workload Context**: Confirm whether the user was expected to be active in multiple regions or environments.\n- **Trace Adversary Movement**: Pivot to related actions (e.g., `s3:ListBuckets`, `iam:ListUsers`, `sts:GetCallerIdentity`) to track further enumeration.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- Automation frameworks that rotate through multiple IPs or cloud functions with dynamic egress IPs may cause this alert to fire.\n- Confirm geolocation and workload context before escalating.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Revoke the Token**: Disable or rotate the IAM credentials and invalidate the temporary session token.\n- **Audit the Environment**: Look for signs of lateral movement or data access during the token's validity.\n- **Strengthen Controls**: Require MFA for high-privilege actions, restrict access via policy conditions (e.g., IP range or device).\n\n### References\n\n- [STS Temporary Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)\n- [Using MFA with Temporary Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html)\n- [AWS Threat Detection Use Cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html)\n",
