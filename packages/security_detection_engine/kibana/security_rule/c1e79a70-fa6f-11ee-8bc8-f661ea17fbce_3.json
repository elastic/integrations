        "note": "## Triage and Analysis\n\n### Investigating AWS EC2 User Data Retrieval for EC2 Instance\n\nThis rule detects requests to retrieve the `userData` attribute of an EC2 instance using the `DescribeInstanceAttribute` API action. The `userData` field can contain sensitive information, such as hardcoded credentials or configuration scripts, that adversaries may exploit for further attacks.\n\n#### Possible Investigation Steps\n\n- **Identify the Target Instance**:\n  - **Instance ID**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.instanceId` field to identify the EC2 instance targeted by the request. Confirm whether this instance should expose its `userData` and whether it is associated with sensitive workloads.\n  - **Analyze userData**: If possible, retrieve and inspect the `userData` field to identify sensitive information like hardcoded credentials or configuration scripts.\n\n- **Review User Context**:\n  - **User Identity**: Inspect the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field to identify the user or role that executed the `DescribeInstanceAttribute` action. Investigate whether this user typically performs such actions.\n  - **Access Patterns**: Validate whether the user or role has the necessary permissions and whether the frequency of this action aligns with expected behavior.\n  - **Access Key ID**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field to determine the key used to make the request as it may be compromised.\n\n- **Analyze Request Details**:\n  - **Parameters**: Verify that the `attribute=userData` parameter was explicitly requested. This indicates intentional access to user data.\n  - **Source IP and Geolocation**: Check the `source.address` and `source.geo` fields to validate whether the request originated from a trusted location or network. Unexpected geolocations can indicate adversarial activity.\n\n- **Review Source Tool**:\n  - **User Agent**: Inspect the `user_agent.original` field to determine the tool or client used (e.g., Terraform, AWS CLI). Legitimate automation tools may trigger this activity, but custom or unknown user agents may indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Check for Related Activity**:\n  - **IAM Changes**: Correlate this event with any IAM changes or temporary credential creation to identify potential privilege escalation attempts.\n  - **API Usage**: Look for other unusual API calls (e.g., `RunInstances`, `GetObject`, `AssumeRole`) by the same user or IP to detect lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.\n\n- **Validate Intent**:\n  - **Permissions and Justification**: Ensure that the user has the least privilege required to perform this action. Investigate whether there is a valid reason for accessing the `userData` field.\n\n### False Positive Analysis\n\n- **Automation**: This event is often triggered by legitimate automation tools, such as Terraform or custom scripts, that require access to `userData` during instance initialization.\n- **Maintenance Activity**: Verify whether this event aligns with expected administrative activities, such as debugging or instance configuration updates.\n\n### Response and Remediation\n\n- **Revoke Excessive Permissions**: If unauthorized, immediately remove `DescribeInstanceAttribute` permissions from the user or role.\n- **Quarantine the Target Instance**: If malicious behavior is confirmed, isolate the affected EC2 instance to limit further exposure.\n- **Secure User Data**:\n  - Avoid storing sensitive information, such as credentials, in `userData`. Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store instead.\n  - Encrypt user data and ensure only authorized users can decrypt it.\n- **Audit IAM Policies**: Regularly review IAM policies to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n- **Monitor and Detect**: Set up additional alerts for unexpected `DescribeInstanceAttribute` calls or other suspicious API activity.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor more details on managing EC2 user data securely, refer to the [AWS EC2 User Data Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html).\n",
