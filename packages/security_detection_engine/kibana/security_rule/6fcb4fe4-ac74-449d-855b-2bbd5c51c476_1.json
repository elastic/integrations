The rule highlights assets with a high volume of distinct vulnerabilities, the presence of exploitable vulnerabilities, or a combination of multiple severities, helping prioritize assets that pose increased risk.\n\n### Possible investigation steps\n\n- Review the affected asset details using `wiz.vulnerability.vulnerable_asset.name` and `wiz.vulnerability.vulnerable_asset.id` to confirm asset ownership, criticality, and exposure (e.g., internet-facing, production).\n- Examine the list of detected vulnerabilities using `Esql.vuln_id_values` to identify known high-risk or widely exploited CVEs.\n- Assess vulnerability severity distribution via `Esql.vuln_severity_values`, focusing on assets with multiple severity levels or repeated high/critical findings.\n- Determine whether any vulnerabilities have known exploits by validating `wiz.vulnerability.has_exploit`, prioritizing those assets for immediate remediation.\n- Cross-check recent patching, configuration changes, or deployment activity on the asset to identify potential gaps or misconfigurations.\n\n### False positive analysis\n\n- Assets undergoing initial onboarding, scanning expansion, or configuration changes may temporarily report a high volume of findings.\n- Vulnerability aggregation may include informational or low-impact findings that inflate counts without representing immediate risk.\n- Duplicate or closely related vulnerabilities affecting shared packages or libraries may appear as multiple findings for the same root cause.\n- Test, lab, or non-production assets may legitimately tolerate higher vulnerability counts depending on risk acceptance.\n\n### Response and remediation\n\n- Prioritize remediation for assets with exploitable vulnerabilities or multiple high/critical severity findings.\n- Apply missing patches, updates, or configuration fixes according to asset criticality and exposure.\n- Implement compensating controls (e.g., network segmentation, access restrictions) if immediate patching is not feasible.\n- Validate remediation by re-scanning the asset in Wiz to confirm vulnerability reduction.\n- Review vulnerability management processes to prevent recurrence, including patch SLAs, asset ownership, and exposure monitoring.",
