# Iptables Integration

This is an integration for `iptables` and `ip6tables` logs. It parses logs
received over the network via syslog (UDP), read from a file, or read from
journald. Also, it understands the prefix added by some Ubiquiti firewalls,
which includes the rule set name, rule number, and the action performed on the
traffic (allow/deny).

The module is by default configured to run with the `udp` input on port `9001`.
However, it can also be configured to read from a file path or journald.

To read Journald logs from within a container, you need to use a
Docker image variant that contains `journalctl` binary. The variant
supporting Journald is `elastic-agent-complete`.

Journal files can have breaking changes making it
impossible to read files generated by a newer versions of
Journald. Ensure the journal files you are reading were generated by
a version equal to or older than the `journalctl` shipped with the Docker
image.

To check the version of `journalctl` shipped with an Elastic Agent
Docker image, run the following command:
```
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint journalctl docker.elastic.co/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-complete:<VERSION>  --version
```
