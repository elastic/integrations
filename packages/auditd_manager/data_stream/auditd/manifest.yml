        description: |
          This setting controls the socket type used to receive events. This setting should
          be set to `unicast` when `elastic-agent` is the primary userspace daemon for receiving
          audit events and managing the rules. Only a single process can receive audit events
          when using unicast sockets, so any other daemons should be stopped (e.g. stop `auditd`).

          Multicast can be enabled with kernel versions 3.16 and newer. By setting it to
          `multicast` `elastic-agent` will receive an audit event broadcast that is not exclusive
          to a single process. This is ideal for situations where `auditd` is running and
          managing the rules.

          If `auto` is selected, `elastic-agent` will attempt to use multicast sockets, falling
          back to unicast if multicast is not available.

        title: Immutable
        show_user: true
        multi: false
        default: false
        description: |
          This boolean setting sets the audit config as immutable (`-e 2`).
          This option can only be used if socket type is not `multicast` since `elastic-agent`
          needs to manage the rules to be able to set it.

          Please note that with this setting enabled, after Elastic Agent restarts or
          upgrades, events will continue to be processed but the configuration won't
          be updated until the system is restarted entirely.

        description: |
          This determines the kernel's behavior on critical
          failures such as errors sending events to `elastic-agent`, the backlog limit was
          exceeded, the kernel ran out of memory, or the rate limit was exceeded. The
          options are `silent`, `log`, or `panic`. `silent` makes the kernel
          ignore the errors, `log` makes the kernel write the audit messages using
          `printk` so they show up in system's syslog, and `panic` causes the kernel to
          panic to prevent use of the machine.

          List of the audit rules that should be
          installed to the kernel. There should be one rule per line. Comments can be
          embedded in the string using `#` as a prefix. The format for rules is the same
          used by the Linux `auditctl` utility. `elastic-agent` supports adding file watches
          (`-w`) and syscall rules (`-a` or `-A`). For more information,
          see the integration detail page.

          A list of files to load audit rules from. This files are loaded after the rules
          declared in `Audit rules` are loaded. Wildcards are supported and will expand in
          lexicographical order. The format is the same as that of the `Audit rules` field.

        description: |
          This sets a rate limit on the number of messages/sec
          delivered by the kernel. The default is `0`, which disables rate limiting.
          Changing this value to anything other than zero can cause messages to be lost.
          The preferred approach to reduce the messaging rate is be more selective in the
          audit ruleset.

        title: Include warnings
        description: |
          Causes to include as warnings any issues that were encountered while parsing the raw
          messages. The messages are written to the `error.message` field.
          When this setting is enabled the raw messages will be included
          in the event regardless of the `Preserve original event` config setting. This
          setting is primarily used for debugging purposes.

        description: |
          Specifies the strategy that used to
          prevent backpressure from propagating to the kernel and impacting audited
          processes.

          The possible values are:

          * `auto`: uses the `kernel` strategy, if supported, or
          falls back to the `userspace` strategy.
          * `kernel`: sets the `backlog_wait_time` in the kernel's
          audit framework to 0. This causes events to be discarded in the kernel if
          the audit backlog queue fills to capacity. Requires a 3.14 kernel or
          newer.
          * `userspace`: drops events when there is backpressure
          from the publishing pipeline. If no `Rate limit` is set, sets a rate
          limit of `5000`. Users should test their setup and adjust the `Rate limit`
          option accordingly.
          * `both`: uses the `kernel` and `userspace` strategies at the same
          time.
          * `none`: No backpressure mitigation measures are enabled.
