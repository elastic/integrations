AMQ9207E: The data received from host '10.212.128.113' on channel '????' is not valid. EXPLANATION: Incorrect data format received from host '10.212.128.113' over TCP/IP. It my be that an unknown host is attempting to send data. An FFST file might be generated containing the invalid data received. It will not be generated if this is the beginning of a conversation with the remote side, and the format is a simple known format (example: a GET request from an HTTP web browser).  If you want to override this, to cause FFST files to be written for any bad data, including simple known formats, then set the environment variable AMQ_BAD_COMMS_DATA_FDCS=TRUE and restart the queue manager. The channel name is '????'; in some cases it cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'. ACTION: Tell the systems administrator.
