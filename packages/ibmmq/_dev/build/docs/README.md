# IBM MQ integration

The IBM MQ Integration is used to fetch observability data from [IBM MQ web endpoints](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq) and ingest it into Elasticsearch.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against `IBM MQ v9.1` and `IBM MQ v9.2`.

## Requirements

In order to ingest data from IBM MQ:
- User should specify the path of IBM MQ Queue Manager Error logs. (default paths: `/var/mqm/errors/*.LOG` and `/var/mqm/qmgrs/*/errors/*.LOG`)

## Logs

### Queue Manager Error logs

The `errorlog` data stream collects [Error logs of Queue Manager](https://www.site24x7.com/help/log-management/ibm-mq-error-logs.html) which include the description, action, explanation and code of the error.
