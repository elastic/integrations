# Imperva Cloud WAF

Imperva Cloud WAF is a cloud-based application delivery service that includes web security, DDoS protection, CDN, and load balancing.

## Data streams

This integration supports ingestion of events from Imperva Cloud WAF, via AWS S3 input or via [Imperva API](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/settings/log-integration.htm).

**Event** is used to retrieve access and security events. See more details in the documentation [here](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/more/log-file-structure.htm).

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).  

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

You have a few options for installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

There are some minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent and for more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

The minimum **Kibana version** required is **8.10.1**.
