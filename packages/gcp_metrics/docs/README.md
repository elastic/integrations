# GCP Metrics Input

The GCP metrics input package can collect metrics for any GCP service.

A list of metrics and services that are available, can be found in the [GCP Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) official documentation.

Custom ingest pipelines can be added through the Kibana UI, to get the data in the desired format.
