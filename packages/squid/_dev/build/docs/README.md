# Squid Proxy

Squid is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. 
Use the Squid Proxy integration to monitor Squid Proxy access logs.

## Data streams

This integration supports ingestion of logs from Squid Proxy, via the [Filestream](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-filestream.html), [TCP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-tcp.html), and/or [UDP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-udp.html) inputs.

**Log** is used to retrieve access log messages generated by Squid Proxy. For more details, refer to [access.log](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs#accesslog) and [Squid native access.log format in detail](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogFormat#squid-native-accesslog-format-in-detail).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md).

The minimum **Kibana version** required is **8.14.1**.

## Setup

[Configure Squid](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogModules#Module:_System_Log) to export access logs using one of the supported methods (file (Module: Standard I/O), udp (Module: UDP Receiver), or tcp (Module: TCP Receiver)).

The integration supports the following format: [Native log file](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogFormat#squid).

### Enable the integration in Elastic

1. In Kibana go to **Management** > **Integrations**.
2. In the **Search for integrations** bar, type `Squid Proxy`.
3. Select the `Squid Proxy` integration from the search results.
4. Click **Add Squid Proxy** to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters according to the enabled input type.
6. Save the integration.
