# Google SecOps

[Google SecOps](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/secops/secops-overview) is a cloud-based service designed for enterprises to retain, analyze, and search large volumes of security and network telemetry. It normalizes, indexes, and correlates data to detect threats. Investigate their scope and cause, and provide remediation through pre-built integrations. The platform enables security analysts to examine aggregated security information, search across domains, and mitigate threats throughout their lifecycle.

The Google SecOps integration collects alerts using the [Detection Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/detection-engine-api#listdetections).

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against the Google SecOps version **v2**.

## Data streams

This integration collects the following logs:

- **[Alerts](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/detection-engine-api#response_fields_3)** - This method enables users to retrieve alerts from Google SecOps.

## Requirements

### Agentless deployment

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. Agentless deployments provide a means to ingest data while avoiding the orchestration, management, and maintenance needs associated with standard ingest infrastructure. Using an agentless deployment makes manual agent deployment unnecessary, allowing you to focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it.

For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html)

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

## Setup

### Collect data from the Google SecOps API

1. Create Google SecOps service account [Steps to create](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#creatinganaccount).

**Chronicle API** must be enabled.

### Enable the Chronicle API

1. Log in to the  "https://console.cloud.google.com/"  using valid credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Chronicle API**.
3. Click **Enabale**.

### Update the Permission of Service Account

1. Open GCP Console, and go to IAM.
2. In **View By Main Tab**, click **GRANT ACCESS**.
3. Add Service Account name in **New Principals**.
4. In **Assign Role**, select **Owner**.
5. Click **Save**.

This integration will make use of the following *oauth2 scope*:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chronicle-backstory`

Once Service Account credentials are downloaded as a JSON file, then the integration can be setup to collect data.
For more details, please refer [Google Chronicle Detection Engine API]( https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/detection-engine-api#getting_api_authentication_credentials).

If installing in GCP-Cloud environment, credentials are not necessary but make sure the account linked with the VM has all the required IAM permissions. Steps to [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana navigate to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" top bar, search for `Google SecOps`.
3. Select the "Google SecOps" integration from the search results.
4. Select "Add Google SecOps" to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters, including the URL, Credentials Type, and Credentials, to enable data collection.
6. Select "Save and continue" to save the integration.

**Note**: The default URL is `https://backstory.googleapis.com`, but this may vary depending on your region. Please refer to the [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/reference/search-api#regional_endpoints) to find the correct URL for your region.
