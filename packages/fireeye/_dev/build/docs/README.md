# Fireeye Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [Fireeye Network Security](https://www.fireeye.com/products/network-security.html) servers. It can parse nx logs created by the HTTP server. 

## Compatibility

The fireeye nx log has been developed against Fireeye Network Security 9.0.0.916432 but is expected to work with other versions.

## Logs

# NX Logs

The `NX` log collects the fireeye nx (network security) logs.
