# BBOT integration

The Bighuge BLS OSINT Tool (BBOT) integration is intended for [BBOT](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/) installations, an Attack Surface Management (ASM) Open Source Inteligence (OSINT) Tool.

Once the BBOT scan is complete, the integration will ingest the results into Elastic.

This integration requires the external use of BBOT. You will have to download and run the tool apart from this integration. Once your scan is complete, this integration can ingest the results into Elastic using the BBOT `json` output module or the `http` output module aka. HTTP POST/webhooks.

As of version `1.1.2` of this integration both BBOT `1.x` and `2.x` are supported. However all examples provided by the module documentation now assume use of BBOT `2.x`.

Please note that BBOT `1.x` formats are currently being supported on a best effort basis only and support will eventually be removed.

Please upgrade to BBOT `2.x` as soon as possible to ensure continuity of features and functionality.

In order to support the conflicting BBOT NDJSON event formats the following occurs during ingest of BBOT `2.x` SCAN events:
1. The `bbot.data.scan` field, if received as an object, is renamed to `bbot.data.scan_config`
2. `bbot.data.scan` is set using the ID and name of the scan in order to replicate the field type and content generated by BBOT `1.x`

This tool is used to enhance your external knowledge of your environment. This is done through the integration of many tools into BBOT providing a overview of your attack surface. Here is [how it works](https://www.blacklanternsecurity.com/bbot/how_it_works/).

**Important Note**

You will have to provide the following parameter in your BBOT scan for your output.json to be formatted correctly.

`-c modules.json.siem_friendly=true`

Or if using the HTTP output modules,

`-c modules.http.siem_friendly=true`

We also strongly recommend ensuring you filter, at minimum, `HTTP_RESPONSE` and `RAW_TEXT` events from reaching the SIEM as these events can contain extreme field data which may not be consumable.

Ensure the configuration option is left at the default or is similar to the following:

```
omit_event_types:
- HTTP_RESPONSE
- RAW_TEXT
```

**Example BBOT Scan**

If using the integration to collect log files from disk, you can simply use the json output module.

`bbot -t example.com -p subdomain-enum -c modules.json.siem_friendly=true -om json`


If using the integration to receive events via HTTP endpoint listener, you can use the the http output module.

`bbot -t example.com -p subdomain-enum --config modules.http.url=http://your.elastic.agent:8080/bbot/asm_intel modules.http.username=bbot modules.http.password=P@55w0rd modules.http.siem_friendly=true -om http`

You will have to configure the path for the output file within the integration settings. A common and popular path that could work here is:

The output modules can also be configured as part of the bbot.yml or preset files.

```
config:
  modules:
    http:
      url: 'https://your.elastic.agent:8443'
      method: POST
      username: 'bbot'
      password: 'P@55w0rd'
      siem_friendly: true
    json:
      siem_friendly: true
```

**Example BBOT Path**

`/home/<user>/.bbot/scans/*/output.json`

## Data streams

This integration collects the following logs:

- **asm_intel** Made up of the findings found in the BBOT Scans.

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details and installation instructions, please refer to the [Elastic Agent Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

There are several options for installing and managing Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

Please note, there are minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent. For more information, refer to the  [Elastic Agent Minimum Requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html#elastic-agent-installation-minimum-requirements).


### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana navigate to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" top bar, search for `BBOT`.
3. Select the "BBOT" integration from the search results.
4. Select "Add BBOT" to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters including the Path to ndjson output file.
6. Save the integration.
