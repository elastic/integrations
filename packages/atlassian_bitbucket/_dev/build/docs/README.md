# Atlassian Bitbucket Integration

The Bitbucket integration collects audit logs from the audit log files or the [audit API](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/reference/rest-api/). 

For more information on auditing in Bitbucket and how it can be configured, see [View and configure the audit log](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/view-and-configure-the-audit-log-776640417.html) on Atlassian's website.

## Agentless Enabled Integration

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).
Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Logs

### Audit

The Bitbucket integration collects audit logs from the audit log files or the audit API from self hosted Bitbucket Data Center. It has been tested with Bitbucket 7.18.1 but is expected to work with newer versions.  This has not been tested with Bitbucket Cloud and is not expected to work.
