# RabbitMQ Integration

This integration uses [HTTP API](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) created by the management plugin to collect metrics.

The default data streams are `connection`, `node`, `queue`, `exchange` and standard logs.

If `management.path_prefix` is set in RabbitMQ configuration, management_path_prefix has to be set to the same value
in this integration configuration.

## Compatibility

The RabbitMQ integration is fully tested with RabbitMQ 3.7.4 and it should be compatible with any version supporting
the management plugin (which needs to be installed and enabled). Exchange dataset is also tested with 3.6.0, 3.6.5 and 3.7.14.

The application logs dataset parses single file format introduced in 3.7.0.

## Logs

### Application Logs

Application logs collects standard RabbitMQ logs.
It will only support RabbitMQ default i.e RFC 3339 timestamp format.

### Node Metrics

The "node" dataset collects metrics about RabbitMQ nodes.

It supports two modes to collect data which can be selected with the "Collection mode" setting:

* `node` - collects metrics only from the node the agent connects to.
* `cluster` - collects metrics from all the nodes in the cluster. This is recommended when collecting metrics of an only endpoint for the whole cluster.

An example event for `node` looks as following:

```json

| Field | Description | Type | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |  |
| agent.id |  | keyword |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment.  Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |  |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |
| host.name | Name of the host.  It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |
| rabbitmq.queue.arguments.max_priority | Maximum number of priority levels for the queue to support. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.auto_delete | Whether the queue will be deleted automatically when no longer used. | boolean |  |
| rabbitmq.queue.consumers.count | Number of consumers. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.consumers.utilisation.pct | Fraction of the time (between 0.0 and 1.0) that the queue is able to immediately deliver messages to consumers. This can be less than 1.0 if consumers are limited by network congestion or prefetch count. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.disk.reads.count | Total number of times messages have been read from disk by this queue since it started. | long | counter |
| rabbitmq.queue.disk.writes.count | Total number of times messages have been written to disk by this queue since it started. | long | counter |
| rabbitmq.queue.durable | Whether or not the queue survives server restarts. | boolean |  |
| rabbitmq.queue.exclusive | Whether the queue is exclusive (i.e. has owner_pid). | boolean |  |
| rabbitmq.queue.memory.bytes | Bytes of memory consumed by the Erlang process associated with the queue, including stack, heap and internal structures. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.persistent.count | Total number of persistent messages in the queue (will always be 0 for transient queues). | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.ready.count | Number of messages ready to be delivered to clients. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.ready.details.rate | How much the count of messages ready has changed per second in the most recent sampling interval. | float | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.total.count | Sum of ready and unacknowledged messages (queue depth). | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.total.details.rate | How much the queue depth has changed per second in the most recent sampling interval. | float | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.unacknowledged.count | Number of messages delivered to clients but not yet acknowledged. | long | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.messages.unacknowledged.details.rate | How much the count of unacknowledged messages has changed per second in the most recent sampling interval. | float | gauge |
| rabbitmq.queue.name | The name of the queue with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C. | keyword |  |
| rabbitmq.queue.state | The state of the queue. Normally 'running', but may be `"\{syncing, MsgCount\}"` if the queue is synchronising. Queues which are located on cluster nodes that are currently down will be shown with a status of 'down'. | keyword |  |
| rabbitmq.vhost | Virtual host name with non-ASCII characters escaped as in C. | keyword |  |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |  |
