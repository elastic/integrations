# DomainTools Real Time Unified Feeds

The DomainTools Real Time Unified Feeds integration allows you to monitor DomainTools Newly Observed Domains. The DomainTools NOD Feed provides real-time access to newly registered and observed domains, enabling proactive threat detection and defense. With over 300,000 new domains observed daily, the feed empowers security teams to identify and block potentially malicious domains before they can be weaponized. Ideal for threat hunting, phishing prevention, and brand protection, the NOD Feed delivers unparalleled visibility into emerging domain activity to stay ahead of evolving threats.

Use the DomainTools Real Time Unified Feeds integration to {purpose}. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference `domaintools.nod_feed` when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to {sample use case} you could {action}. Then you can {visualize|alert|troubleshoot} by {action}. -->

## Data streams

The DomainTools Real Time Unified Feeds integration collects one type of data streams: logs

<!-- If applicable -->
<!-- **Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in {service}.
Log data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Logs](#logs-reference). -->

<!-- If applicable -->
<!-- **Metrics** give you insight into the state of {service}.
Metric data streams collected by the {name} integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Metrics](#metrics-reference). -->

<!-- Optional: Any additional notes on data streams -->

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

<!--
	Optional: Other requirements including:
	* System compatibility
	* Supported versions of third-party products
	* Permissions needed
	* Anything else that could block a user from successfully using the integration

<!-- Repeat for each data stream of the current type -->
<!-- ### {Data stream name}

The `{data stream name}` data stream provides events from {source} of the following types: {list types}. -->

<!-- Optional -->
<!-- #### Example

An example event for `{data stream name}` looks as following:

{code block with example} -->

<!-- #### Exported fields

{insert table} -->
