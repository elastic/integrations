    - name: host.id
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Unique host id.
        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment.
        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.

        The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.
    - name: host.name
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Name of the host.
        It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host.

    - name: host.os.type
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.
        If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition.

      description: Operating system version as a raw string.
    - name: host.type
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Type of host.
        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment.
    - name: host.uptime
      type: long
      description: Seconds the host has been up.
    - name: vulnerability.category
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        The type of system or architecture that the vulnerability affects. These may be platform-specific (for example, Debian or SUSE) or general (for example, Database or Firewall). For example (https://qualysguard.qualys.com/qwebhelp/fo_portal/knowledgebase/vulnerability_categories.htm[Qualys vulnerability categories])
        This field must be an array.

      type: float
      description: |-
        Scores can range from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 being the most severe.
        Base scores cover an assessment for exploitability metrics (attack vector, complexity, privileges, and user interaction), impact metrics (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and scope. For example (https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)
    - name: vulnerability.score.version
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides qualitative severity rankings of "Low", "Medium", and "High" for CVSS v2.0 base score ranges in addition to the severity ratings for CVSS v3.0 as they are defined in the CVSS v3.0 specification.
        CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams across the world. For example (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
    - name: vulnerability.severity
      type: keyword
      description: The severity of the vulnerability can help with metrics and internal prioritization regarding remediation. For example (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
