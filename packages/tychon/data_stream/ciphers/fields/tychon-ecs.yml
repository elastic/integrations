        Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Name of the service data is collected from.
        The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name.
        In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified.
