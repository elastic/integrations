    Date/time when the event originated.
    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
    Required field for all events.
  name: '@timestamp'
  type: date
- description: |-
    The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data.
    Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`.
    Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:
      * Must not contain `-`
      * No longer than 100 characters

    A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data.
    Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`.
    Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:

    An overarching type for the data stream.
    Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future.

    ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.
    When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.

    Agents are normally responsible for populating the `agent.id` field value. If the system receiving events is capable of validating the value based on authentication information for the client then this field can be used to reflect the outcome of that validation.
    For example if the agent's connection is authenticated with mTLS and the client cert contains the ID of the agent to which the cert was issued then the `agent.id` value in events can be checked against the certificate. If the values match then `event.agent_id_status: verified` is added to the event, otherwise one of the other allowed values should be used.
    If no validation is performed then the field should be omitted.
    The allowed values are:
    `verified` - The `agent.id` field value matches expected value obtained from auth metadata.
    `mismatch` - The `agent.id` field value does not match the expected value obtained from auth metadata.
    `missing` - There was no `agent.id` field in the event to validate.
    `auth_metadata_missing` - There was no auth metadata or it was missing information about the agent ID.

    Name of the domain of which the host is a member.
