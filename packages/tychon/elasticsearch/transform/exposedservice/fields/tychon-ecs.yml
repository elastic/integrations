    - name: host.domain
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Name of the domain of which the host is a member.
        For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider.

      description: |-
        Hostname of the host.
        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.
    - name: host.id
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Unique host id.
        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment.
        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.

        The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.
    - name: host.name
      type: keyword
      description: |-
        Name of the host.
        It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host.

        Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families.
        If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition.
