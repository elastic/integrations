# Menlo Security Integration

The Menlo Security integration allows you to monitor [Menlo Security Products](https://www.menlosecurity.com/product-overview/).

Use the Menlo Security integration to collect logs from your server. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference data when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to {sample use case} you could {action}. Then you can {visualize|alert|troubleshoot} by {action}.

## Data streams

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening on the network using APIs.
Log data streams collected by the Menlo Security integration include {sample data stream(s)} and more. See more details in the [Logs](#logs-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
