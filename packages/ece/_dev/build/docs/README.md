# ECE Integration

The ECE Integration allows you to collect the Adminconsole logs which contain all actions performed through the admin UI and as well as through the API. The Elastic Agent collecting this logs needs to be installed on all Control Planes in ECE, as the Control Planes usually host the adminconsole container.
