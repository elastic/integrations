# Corelight

[Corelight](https://corelight.com/) provides network detection and response (NDR) solutions that enhance visibility, threat detection, and incident response by leveraging open-source technologies like Zeek. Its platform integrates with existing security tools to deliver high-fidelity network data, helping organizations detect and respond to threats more effectively across both on-premises and cloud environmentsâ€‹.

This integration includes only the Corelight dashboards for Security Posture, Remote Activity Insights, Name Resolution Insights, and Secure Channel Insights.

## Prerequisites:

**Add ECS Mappings**: Start by adding the ECS (Elastic Common Schema) mappings from the [Corelight GitHub repository](https://github.com/corelight). You can find the required templates here: [Corelight ECS Templates](https://github.com/corelight/ecs-templates). These mappings will ensure that Corelight data is correctly formatted and aligned with Elastic's schema.

**Send Data from Corelight to Elastic**: Once the ECS mappings are in place, configure Corelight to send data directly to your Elastic environment.

**Note**: Use the default index (logs-*) name instead of a custom index.

## Setup

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana go to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar, type Corelight.
3. Click on the "Corelight" integration from the search results.
4. Go to Settings.
5. Click on the "Install Corelight assets".
