# Google Workspace Integration

## Compatibility

It is compatible with a subset of applications under the [Google Reports API v1](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/get-start/getting-started). As of today it supports:

## Requirements

In order to ingest data from the Google Reports API you must:

- Have an *administrator account*.
- [Set up a ServiceAccount](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222993?hl=en) using the administrator account.
- [Set up access to the Admin SDK API](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222865?hl=en) for the ServiceAccount.
- [Enable Domain-Wide Delegation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/delegation) for your ServiceAccount.

This module will make use of the following *oauth2 scope*:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`

Once you have downloaded your service account credentials as a JSON file, you are ready to set up your integration.
