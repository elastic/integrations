None should take a second.\n* Iddiscover.exe stored procedures can run for much longer. Minutes to hours in large environments to process large changes in bulk. \n\nStrategies for improving the performance of these stored procedures include:\n\n* Rebuild fragmented database indexes\n* Review if database is low on RAM, CPU, or I/O bandwidth.\n\nIf  you continue to encounter problems developers will require database execution plans to review the operation of these procedures.
