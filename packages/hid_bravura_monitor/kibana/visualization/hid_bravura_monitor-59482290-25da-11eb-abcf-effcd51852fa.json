There is a direct correlation between search time and user experience.\n\nAs a general rule, Search stored procedures should take less than a second to run on average. \n\nSearch stored procedure performance is impacted by elements such as:\n\n* Data size. Larger data consumes more CPU, Ram, Disk I/O on the database server. \n* Policies such as acls, filtering, etc. \n* Indexes. Sometimes they fragment degrading overall performance. \n* Table/Index Locking with other database actions.\n\nStrategies for improving database search performance include:\n\n* Rebuild fragmented database indexes.\n* Evaluate if more RAM/CPU\n\nWhen these don't work, Developers will need database execution plans to review options.",
