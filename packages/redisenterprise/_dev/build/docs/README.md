# Redis Enterprise

Redis Enterprise integration provides monitoring of [redis](https://redis.com/) cluster. Monitoring is done via prometheus exported port of redis enterprise cluster. Once a redis enterprise [cluster](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/technology/redis-enterprise-cluster-architecture/) is installed, prometheus port is available for monitoring. The url of the host:port(8070) needs to be passed to the hosts in the settings.

## Compatibility
Tested with Redis Enterprise v7.2.4.
