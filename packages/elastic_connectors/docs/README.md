# Elastic Connectors

A connector is a type of Elastic integration that syncs data from an original data source to an **Elasticsearch index**. Connectors enable you to create searchable, read-only replicas of your data sources.

Connectors extract the original files, records, or objects; and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents.
