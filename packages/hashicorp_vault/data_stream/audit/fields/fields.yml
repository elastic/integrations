                Display name is a non-security sensitive identifier that is applicable to this auth. It is used for logging and prefixing of dynamic secrets. For example, it may be "armon" for the github credential backend. If the client token is used to generate a SQL credential, the user may be "github-armon-uuid". This is to help identify the source without using audit tables.
