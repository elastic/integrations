# Hashicorp Vault

This integration collects logs and metrics from Hashicorp Vault. There are
three data streams:

- audit - Audit logs from file or TCP socket.
- log - Operation log from file.
- metrics - Telemetry data from the /sys/metrics API.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested with Vault 1.7.

## Audit Logs

Vault audit logs provide a detailed accounting of who accessed or modified what
secrets. The logs do not contain the actual secret values (for strings), but
instead contain the value hashed with a salt using HMAC-SHA256. Hashes can be
compared to values by using the
[`/sys/audit-hash`](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/system/audit-hash.html) API.

In order to use this integration for audit logs you must configure Vault
to use a [`file` audit device](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit/file)
or [`socket` audit device](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit/socket). The
file audit device provides the strongest delivery guarantees.

### File audit device requirements

- Create a directory for audit logs on each Vault server host.

```
mkdir /var/log/vault
```

- Enable the file audit device.

```
vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault/audit.json
```

- Configure log rotation for the audit log. The exact steps may vary by OS.
This example uses `logrotate` to call `systemctl reload` on the
[Vault service](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/deployment-guide#step-3-configure-systemd)
which sends the process a SIGHUP signal. The SIGHUP signal causes Vault to start
writing to a new log file.

```
tee /etc/logrotate.d/vault <<'EOF'
/var/log/vault/audit.json {
    rotate 7
    daily
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    extension json
    dateext
    dateformat %Y-%m-%d.
    postrotate
        /bin/systemctl reload vault || true
    endscript
}
EOF
```

### Socket audit device requirements

To enable the socket audit device in Vault you should first enable this
integration because Vault will test that it can connect to the TCP socket.

- Add this integration and enable audit log collection via TCP. If Vault will
be connecting remotely set the listen address to 0.0.0.0.

- Configure the socket audit device to stream logs to this integration.
Substitute in the IP address of the Elastic Agent to which you are sending the
audit logs.

```
vault audit enable socket address=${ELASTIC_AGENT_IP}:9007 socket_type=tcp
```

An example event for `audit` looks as following:

```json

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

## Operational Logs

Vault outputs its logs to stdout. In order to use the package to collect the
operational log you will need to direct its output to a file.

This table shows how the Vault field names are mapped in events. The remaining
structured data fields (indicated by the `*`) are placed under
`hashicorp_vault.log` which is mapped as `flattened` to allow for arbitrary
fields without causing mapping explosions or type conflicts.

| Original Field 	| Package Field         	|
|----------------	|-----------------------	|
| `@timestamp`   	| `@timestamp`          	|
| `@module`      	| `log.logger`          	|
| `@level`       	| `log.level`           	|
| `@message`     	| `message`             	|
| `*`            	| `hashicorp_vault.log` 	|

### Requirements

By default, Vault uses its `standard` log output as opposed to `json`. Please
enable the JSON output in order to have the log data in a structured format. In
a config file for Vault add the following:

```hcl
log_format = "json"
```

An example event for `log` looks as following:

```json

## Metrics

Vault can provide [telemetry](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/telemetry)
information in the form of Prometheus metrics. You can verify that metrics are
enabled by making an HTTP request to
`http://vault_server:8200/v1/sys/metrics?format=prometheus` on your Vault server.

### Requirements

You must configure the Vault prometheus endpoint to disable the hostname
prefixing. It's recommended to also enable the hostname label.

```hcl
telemetry {
  disable_hostname = true
  enable_hostname_label = true
}
```

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| hashicorp_vault.metrics.\*.\* | Hashicorp Vault telemetry data from the Prometheus endpoint. |  |
| labels | Custom key/value pairs. Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects. All values are stored as keyword. Example: `docker` and `k8s` labels. | object |
| labels.auth_method | Authorization engine type. | keyword |
| labels.cluster | The cluster name from which the metric originated; set in the configuration file, or automatically generated when a cluster is created. | keyword |
| labels.creation_ttl | Time-to-live value assigned to a token or lease at creation. This value is rounded up to the next-highest bucket; the available buckets are 1m, 10m, 20m, 1h, 2h, 1d, 2d, 7d, and 30d. Any longer TTL is assigned the value +Inf. | keyword |
| labels.host |  | keyword |
| labels.instance |  | keyword |
| labels.job |  | keyword |
| labels.local |  | keyword |
| labels.mount_point | Path at which an auth method or secret engine is mounted. | keyword |
| labels.namespace | A namespace path, or root for the root namespace | keyword |
| labels.quantile |  | keyword |
| labels.queue_id |  | keyword |
| labels.term |  | keyword |
| labels.token_type | Identifies whether the token is a batch token or a service token. | keyword |
| labels.type |  | keyword |
| labels.version |  | keyword |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |
