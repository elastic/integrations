# Sophos Central Integration

The [Sophos Central](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/sophos-central) integration allows you to monitor Alerts and Events logs. Sophos Central is a cloud-native application with high availability. It is a cybersecurity management platform hosted on public cloud platforms. Each Sophos Central account is hosted in a named region. Sophos Central uses well-known, widely used, and industry-standard software libraries to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

Use the Sophos Central integration to collect logs across Sophos Central managed by your Sophos account.
Visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference data when troubleshooting an issue.

## Data streams

The Sophos Central integration collects logs for two types of events: alerts and events.

**Alerts**: See Example Schema [here](https://developer.sophos.com/docs/siem-v1/1/routes/alerts/get) for more information.

**Events**: See Example Schema [here](https://developer.sophos.com/docs/siem-v1/1/routes/events/get) for more information.

## Compatibility

The Sophos Central Application does not feature version numbers. This integration has been configured and tested against **Sophos Central SIEM Integration API version v1**.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data, and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
