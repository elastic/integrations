# SQL input

The SQL input package allows you to execute custom queries against an SQL database and store the results in Elasticsearch.

This input package supports the below listed databases:

- MySQL
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL
- PostgreSQL

## Configuration Options for the User:


### Hosts: 
The host configuration should be specified from where the metrics are to be fetched. It varies depending upon the driver you are running

#### MySQL: 
The supported configuration takes this form
- `<user>:<password>@tcp(<host>:<port>)/`

Example of supported configuration is as below:
- `root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/`

#### Oracle: 

The following two types of host configurations are supported:

1. Old style host configuration :

    a. `hosts: ["user/pass@0.0.0.0:1521/ORCLPDB1.localdomain"]`
    
    b. `hosts: ["user/password@0.0.0.0:1521/ORCLPDB1.localdomain as sysdba"]`

2. DSN host configuration:

    a. `hosts: ['user="user" password="pass" connectString="0.0.0.0:1521/ORCLPDB1.localdomain"']`
    
    b. `hosts: ['user="user" password="password" connectString="host:port/service_name" sysdba=true']`
  
#### MSSQL: 
The supported configuration takes this form
- `sqlserver://<user>:<password>@<host>`

Example of supported configurations is as below:
- `sqlserver://root:test@localhost`

#### PostgreSQL: 
The supported configuration takes this form
- `postgres://<user>:<password>@<connection_string>`

Example of supported configuration is as below:
- `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/stuff?sslmode=disable`

Note: If the password contains the backslash (`\`) character, it must be escaped with a backslash. For example, if the password is `my\_password`, it should be written as `my\\_password`.

### Driver
Specify the driver for which you want to run the queries. Below are the supported drivers:

- mysql
- oracle
- mssql
- postgres

### SQL_Queries
Receives the list of queries to execute. query and response_format is repeated to get multiple query inputs.

Eg:   
sql_queries: 
  - query: SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_system%'
    
    response_format: variables

response_format: This can be either variables or table

variables:
Expects a two-column table that looks like a key/value result. The left column is considered a key and the right column the value. This mode generates a single event on each fetch operation.

table:
Expects any number of columns. This mode generates a single event for each row.

For more examples of response format please refer [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-sql.html)


### Merge Results
Merge multiple queries into a single event.

Multiple queries will create multiple events, one for each query.  It may be preferable to create a single event by combining the metrics together in a single event.

This feature can be enabled using the `merge_results` config.

`merge_results` can merge queries having response format as "variable". 
However, for queries with a response format as "table", a merge is possible only if each table query produces a single row.

For example, if we have 2 queries as below for PostgreSQL:

sql_queries:
  - query: "SELECT blks_hit,blks_read FROM pg_stat_database LIMIT 1;"
    response_format: table

  - query: "SELECT checkpoints_timed,checkpoints_req FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;"
    response_format: table

The `merge_results` feature will create a combined event, where `blks_hit`, `blks_read`, `checkpoints_timed` and `checkpoints_req` are part of the same event.

### Fetch from all databases (for `mssql` driver only)

Executes given queries for all database(s) present in a server

Assuming a user could have 100s of databases on their server and then it becomes cumbersome to add them manually to the query. If `fetch_from_all_databases` is set to true then SQL module would fetch the databases names automatically and prefix the database selector statement to the queries so that the queries can run against the database provided.

Currently, this feature only works with `mssql` driver, for example, if we set the query to:

```
- query: SELECT DB_NAME() AS 'database_name';
  response_format: table
```

For an mssql instance, by default only four databases are present namely â€” `master`, `model`, `msdb`, `tempdb`. So, if `fetch_from_all_databases` is enabled then query `SELECT DB_NAME() AS 'database_name'` runs for each one of them i.e., there would be in total 4 documents (one each for 4 databases) for every scrape.
