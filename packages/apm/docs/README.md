# APM Integration

Elastic APM is an application performance monitoring system built on the Elastic Stack. It allows you to monitor software services and applications in real-time, by collecting detailed performance information on response time for incoming requests, database queries, calls to caches, external HTTP requests, and more.

The APM integration enables central management of APM Server with Fleet.
To learn more, see [Fleet-managed APM Server](https://ela.st/apm-fleet).
