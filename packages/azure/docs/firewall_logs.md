# Azure Firewall Logs

The Azure Logs integration retrieves different types of log data from Azure.

There are several requirements before using the integration since the logs will actually be read from azure event hubs.

- The logs have to be [exported first to the event hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled).
- To export activity logs to event hubs users can follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-export).
- To export audit and sign-in logs to event hubs users can follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub).

## Settings

`eventhub` :
  _string_
An Event Hub is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service. Elastic recommends using only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character for Event Hub names to maximize compatibility. You can use existing Event Hubs having underscores (_) in the Event Hub name; in this case, the integration will replace underscores with hyphens (-) when it uses the Event Hub name to create dependent Azure resources behind the scenes (e.g., the storage account container to store Event Hub consumer offsets).
Default value `insights-operational-logs`.

`consumer_group` :
_string_
 The publish/subscribe mechanism of Event Hubs is enabled through consumer groups. A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.
Default value: `$Default`

`connection_string` :
_string_
The connection string is required to communicate with Event Hubs, see steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).

A Blob Storage account is required in order to store/retrieve/update the offset or state of the eventhub messages. This means that after stopping the Azure logs package it can start back up at the spot that it stopped processing messages.

`storage_account` :
_string_
The name of the storage account where the state/offsets will be stored and updated.

`storage_account_key` :
_string_
The storage account key, this key will be used to authorize access to data in your storage account.

`resource_manager_endpoint` :
_string_
Optional, by default we are using the azure public environment, to override, users can provide a specific resource manager endpoint in order to use a different azure environment.

Resource manager endpoints:

## Logs

### firewall_logs 

The `firewall_logs` data stream of the Azure Logs package will collect any firewall log events that have been streamed through an Azure event hub.

An example event for `firewall` looks as following:

| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| destination.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| destination.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| destination.bytes | Bytes sent from the destination to the source. | long |
| destination.domain | The domain name of the destination system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| destination.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.nat.ip | Translated ip of destination based NAT sessions (e.g. internet to private DMZ) Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | ip |
| destination.nat.port | Port the source session is translated to by NAT Device. Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | long |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| dns.header_flags | Array of 2 letter DNS header flags. Expected values are: AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, CD, DO. | keyword |
| dns.question.class | The class of records being queried. | keyword |
| dns.question.name | The name being queried. If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively. | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| dns.response_code |  |  |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| observer.name | Custom name of the observer. This is a name that can be given to an observer. This can be helpful for example if multiple firewalls of the same model are used in an organization. If no custom name is needed, the field can be left empty. | keyword |
| observer.product | The product name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.type | The type of the observer the data is coming from. There is no predefined list of observer types. Some examples are `forwarder`, `firewall`, `ids`, `ips`, `proxy`, `poller`, `sensor`, `APM server`. | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| rule.category | A categorization value keyword used by the entity using the rule for detection of this event. | keyword |
| rule.id | A rule ID that is unique within the scope of an agent, observer, or other entity using the rule for detection of this event. | keyword |
| rule.name | The name of the rule or signature generating the event. | keyword |
| rule.ruleset | Name of the ruleset, policy, group, or parent category in which the rule used to generate this event is a member. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `source.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| source.bytes | Bytes sent from the source to the destination. | long |
| source.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| source.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| source.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| source.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
