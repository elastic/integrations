# Azure Firewall Logs

The Azure Logs integration retrieves different types of log data from Azure.

There are several requirements before using the integration since the logs will actually be read from azure event hubs.

- The logs have to be [exported first to the event hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled).
- To export activity logs to event hubs users can follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-log-export).
- To export audit and sign-in logs to event hubs users can follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub).

## Settings

`eventhub` :
  _string_
An Event Hub is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service. Elastic recommends using only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character for Event Hub names to maximize compatibility. You can use existing Event Hubs having underscores (_) in the Event Hub name; in this case, the integration will replace underscores with hyphens (-) when it uses the Event Hub name to create dependent Azure resources behind the scenes (e.g., the storage account container to store Event Hub consumer offsets).
Default value `insights-operational-logs`.

`consumer_group` :
_string_
 The publish/subscribe mechanism of Event Hubs is enabled through consumer groups. A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.
Default value: `$Default`

`connection_string` :
_string_
The connection string is required to communicate with Event Hubs, see steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).

A Blob Storage account is required in order to store/retrieve/update the offset or state of the eventhub messages. This means that after stopping the Azure logs package it can start back up at the spot that it stopped processing messages.

`storage_account` :
_string_
The name of the storage account where the state/offsets will be stored and updated.

`storage_account_key` :
_string_
The storage account key, this key will be used to authorize access to data in your storage account.

`resource_manager_endpoint` :
_string_
Optional, by default we are using the azure public environment, to override, users can provide a specific resource manager endpoint in order to use a different azure environment.

Resource manager endpoints:
