# Azure Eventhub Input

The Azure Eventhub Input integration allows users to collect events from Azure event hubs.
 The azure-eventhub input functionality is based on the the event processor host (EPH is intended to be run across multiple processes and machines while load balancing message consumers more on this here https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-go#event-processor-host, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-event-processor-host). State such as leases on partitions and checkpoints in the event stream are shared between receivers using an Azure Storage container. 
 For this reason, as a prerequisite to using this input, users will have to create or use an existing storage account.

There are several requirements before using the integration since the logs will actually be read from azure event hubs.
   * the logs/metrics have to be exported first to the event hub https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled

## Settings

`eventhub` :
  _string_
It is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service. Elastic recommends using only letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character for Event Hub names to maximize compatibility. You can use existing Event Hubs having underscores (_) in the Event Hub name; in this case, the integration will replace underscores with hyphens (-) when it uses the Event Hub name to create dependent Azure resources behind the scenes (e.g., the storage account container to store Event Hub consumer offsets).

`consumer_group` :
_string_
 The publish/subscribe mechanism of Event Hubs is enabled through consumer groups. A consumer group is a view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.
Default value: `$Default`

`connection_string` :
_string_
The connection string required to communicate with Event Hubs, steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string.

A Blob Storage account is required in order to store/retrieve/update the offset or state of the eventhub messages. This means that after stopping the filebeat azure module it can start back up at the spot that it stopped processing messages.

`storage_account` :
_string_
The name of the storage account the state/offsets will be stored and updated.

`storage_account_key` :
_string_
The storage account key, this key will be used to authorize access to data in your storage account.

`resource_manager_endpoint` :
_string_
Optional, by default we are using the azure public environment, to override, users can provide a specific resource manager endpoint in order to use a different azure environment.

Resource manager endpoints:

## Logs

### eventhub

The `eventhub` data stream of the Azure Logs package will collect any events that have been streamed through an azure event hub.
