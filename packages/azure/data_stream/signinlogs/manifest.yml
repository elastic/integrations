          This is the container in the storage account where the integration stores the checkpoint data for the consumer group. The integration generates a default container name if not specified. Each integration MUST have a dedicated container; do not reuse the same container for multiple integrations. See [Container Names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names) for details on naming rules from Microsoft.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
