          The storage account container where the integration stores the checkpoint data for the consumer group. It is an advanced option to use with extreme care. You MUST use a dedicated storage account container for each Azure log type (activity, sign-in, audit logs, and others). DO NOT REUSE the same container name for more than one Azure log type. See [Container Names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names) for details on naming rules from Microsoft. The integration generates a default container name if not specified.

          (Processor v2 only) Controls from what position in the event hub the processor should start processing messages for all partitions.

          Possible values are `earliest` and `latest`.

          `earliest` starts processing messages from the last checkpoint, or the beginning of the event hub if no checkpoint is available.

          `latest` starts processing messages from the the latest event in the event hub and continues to process new events as they arrive.

          Default is `earliest`.

          The checkpoint migration converts the checkpoint information from the v1 format to the v2 format.

          Default is `false`, which means the processor will not perform the checkpoint migration.
