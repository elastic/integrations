    title: Collect Azure logs from Event Hub
    description: |

      Collect all the supported (see list below) Azure logs from Event Hub to a target data stream.

      âœ¨ **New in version 1.20.0+:** by enabling this integration, you can collect all the logs from the following Azure services and route them to the appropriate data stream:

      - Microsoft Entra ID logs:
        - Audit
        - Identity Protection
        - Provisioning
        - Sign-in
      - Platform logs
      - Activity logs
      - Microsoft Graph Activity Logs
      - Spring Apps logs
      - Firewall logs
      - Application Gateway logs

      **You MUST turn off the v1 integrations** when you enable this v2 integration. If you run both integrations simultaneously, you will see duplicate logs in your data stream.

      If you need to collect raw events from Azure Event Hub, we recommend using the [Custom Azure Logs integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/azure_logs) which provides more flexibility.

      To learn more about the efficiency and routing enhancements introduced in version 1.20.0, please read the [Azure Logs (v2 preview)](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/azure/events) documentation.

          The storage account container where the integration stores the checkpoint data for the consumer group. It is an advanced option to use with extreme care. You MUST use a dedicated storage account container for each Azure log type (activity, sign-in, audit logs, and others). DO NOT REUSE the same container name for more than one Azure log type. See [Container Names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names) for details on naming rules from Microsoft. The integration generates a default container name if not specified.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
