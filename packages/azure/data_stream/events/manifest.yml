    title: Collect Azure logs from Event Hub
    description: |

      Collect all the supported (see list below) Azure logs from Event Hub to a target data stream.

      âœ¨ **New in version 1.20.0+:** by enabling this integration, you can collect all the logs from the following Azure services and route them to the appropriate data stream:

      - Microsoft Entra ID logs:
        - Audit
        - Identity Protection
        - Provisioning
        - Sign-in
      - Platform logs
      - Activity logs
      - Microsoft Graph Activity Logs
      - Spring Apps logs
      - Firewall logs
      - Application Gateway logs

      **You MUST turn off the v1 integrations** when you enable this v2 integration. If you run both integrations simultaneously, you will see duplicate logs in your data stream.

      If you need to collect raw events from Azure Event Hub, we recommend using the [Custom Azure Logs integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/azure_logs) which provides more flexibility.

      To learn more about the efficiency and routing enhancements introduced in version 1.20.0, please read the [Azure Logs (v2 preview)](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/azure/events) documentation.

          The storage account container where the integration stores the checkpoint data. It is an advanced option to use with extreme care. You MUST use a dedicated storage account container for this integration. DO NOT REUSE the same container name for more than one integration. See [Container Names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#container-names) for details on naming rules from Microsoft. The integration generates a default container name if not specified.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.

          The processor version that the integration should use.
          Possible values are `v1` and `v2` (preview). 
          
          The v2 event hub processor is in preview, so using the v1 processor
          is recommended for typical use cases.
          
          Default is `v1`.

        description: >-
          (Processor v2 only) Controls from what position in the event hub
          the processor should start processing messages for all partitions.
          
          Possible values are `earliest` and `latest`.
          
          `earliest` starts processing messages from the last checkpoint, or the
          beginning of the event hub if no checkpoint is available.

          `latest` starts processing messages from the the latest event in the
          event hub and continues to process new events as they arrive.
          
          Default is `earliest`.

          (Processor v2 only) Flag to control if the processor should perform 
          the checkpoint information migration from processor v1 to v2
          at startup.
          
          The checkpoint migration converts the checkpoint information
          from the v1 format to the v2 format.

          Default is `false`, which means the processor will not perform the
          checkpoint migration.

          The partition consumer waits up to a "receive count" or a
          "receive timeout", whichever comes first.

          Default is `5` seconds.

          Default is `100` messages.
