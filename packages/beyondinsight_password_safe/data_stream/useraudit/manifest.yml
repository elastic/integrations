          The request tracer logs requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging. Disabling the request tracer will delete any stored traces. See [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-cel.html#_resource_tracer_enable) for details.
