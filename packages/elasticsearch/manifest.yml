              By default, scope is set to node and each entry in the hosts list indicates a distinct node in an Elasticsearch cluster.  If the scope is set to cluster then each entry in the hosts list indicates a single endpoint for a distinct Elasticsearch cluster (for example, a load-balancing proxy fronting the cluster).  Cluster should be used if the cluster has dedicated master nodes, and configure the endpoint in the hosts list not to direct requests to the dedicated master nodes.
