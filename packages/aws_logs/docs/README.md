# Custom AWS Log integration

The custom AWS Log package offers users two ways to collect logs from AWS: from S3 bucket(with or without SQS notification)  and from CloudWatch.
Custom ingest pipelines may be added by adding the name to the pipeline configuration option, creating custom ingest pipelines can be done either through the API or the [Ingest Node Pipeline UI](/app/management/ingest/ingest_pipelines/).
