# Tines Integration

Tines makes data, including logs, related to use and configuration of a Tines tenant available via a REST API.

This integration can be used to collect:
1. [audit logs](https://www.tines.com/api/audit-logs)

The Tines API documentation is available via [this page](https://www.tines.com/api/welcome).

## Compatibility

The package collects "audit log" events from the Tines API.

At present the only API version available, and hence the version assumed to be polled by this integration, is v1.

The only API endpoint utilised is currently the [audit logs list endpoint](https://www.tines.com/api/audit-logs/list).

## Configuration

### Find your Tines tenant URL

This is available within the Tines web interface via the URL bar, e.g. https://your-tenant-1234.tines.com

### Create a Tines user API key

Refer to [this documentation](https://www.tines.com/api/authentication) from Tines regarding how to create an API key.

The API key can be either a Personal or Tenant API key.

### Enabling the integration in Elastic

1. In Kibana go to **Management > Integrations**
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar type **Tines**
3. Click on "Tines" integration from the search results.
4. Click on **Add Tines** button to add the Tines integration.
5. Modify the Tines Tenant URL as appropriate
6. Insert your Tines API user email address
7. Insert the Tines API key created associated with the API user email address

## Data Stream

### audit_logs

All fields ingested to this data stream are stored under `tines.audit_log` as each audit_log event is stored individually.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| input.type |  | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `source.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| source.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| source.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| source.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| source.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.user.domain | Name of the directory the user is a member of. For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name. | keyword |
| source.user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| source.user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| source.user.name.text | Multi-field of `source.user.name`. | match_only_text |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.created_at | The date and time that the audit log event occurred | date |
| tines.audit_log.id | A unique ID for the audit log event | long |
| tines.audit_log.inputs.inputs.authenticationTokenId |  | long |
| tines.audit_log.inputs.inputs.isServiceToken |  | boolean |
| tines.audit_log.inputs.inputs.name |  | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.operation_name | The name of the operation | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.request_ip | The IP Address the operation was triggered from | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.request_user_agent | The user agent that the operation was triggered with | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.tenant_id | The ID of the tenant the operation was triggered on | long |
| tines.audit_log.updated_at | The date and time that the audit log event was updated | date |
| tines.audit_log.user_email | The email of the user who triggered the operation | keyword |
| tines.audit_log.user_id | The ID of the user who triggered the operation | long |
| tines.audit_log.user_name | The name of the user who triggered the operation | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| user.domain | Name of the directory the user is a member of. For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name. | keyword |
| user.email | User email address. | keyword |
| user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.original.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.original`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.full`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| user_agent.os.type | Use the `os.type` field to categorize the operating system into one of the broad commercial families. If the OS you're dealing with is not listed as an expected value, the field should not be populated. Please let us know by opening an issue with ECS, to propose its addition. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| user_agent.version | Version of the user agent. | keyword |
