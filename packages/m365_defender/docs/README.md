# M365 Defender integration

## Overview

The [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender) integration allows you to monitor Alert, Incident (Microsoft Graph Security API) and Event (Streaming API) Logs. Microsoft 365 Defender is a unified pre and post-breach enterprise defense suite that natively coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications to provide integrated protection against sophisticated attacks.

Use the Microsoft 365 Defender integration to collect and parse data from the Microsoft Azure Event Hub, Microsoft Graph Security v1.0 REST API and Microsoft 365 Defender API. Then visualise that data in Kibana.

For example, you could use the data from this integration to consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources. Also, by looking into the alert and incident, a user can take an appropriate action in the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal.

## Data streams

The Microsoft 365 Defender integration collects logs for four types of events: Alert, Event, Incident and Log.

**Alert:** This data streams leverages the [M365 Defender Streaming API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alert?view=graph-rest-1.0) to collect alerts including suspicious activities in a customer's tenant that Microsoft or partner security providers have identified and flagged for action.

**Event (Recommended):** This data streams leverages the [M365 Defender Streaming API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/streaming-api?view=o365-worldwide) to collect Alert, Device, Email, App and Identity Events. Events are streamed to an Azure Event Hub. For a list of Supported Events exposed by the Streaming API and supported by Elastic's integration, please see Microsoft's documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/supported-event-types?view=o365-worldwide).

**Incidents and Alerts (Recommended):** This data streams leverages the [Microsoft Graph Security API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) to ingest a collection of correlated alert instances and associated metadata that reflects the story of an attack in M365D. Incidents stemming from Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention are supported by this integration.

**Log (Deprecated):** This data stream is not recommend as it collects incidents from the SIEM API that Microsoft plans to deprecate. The data stream will be removed when Microsoft has deprecated the SIEM API. If you are currently using this data stream, we recommend moving to the Incident data stream which supports Microsoft's Graph Security API. The incidents data stream collects the same data as the log data stream. Please see Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-siem?view=o365-worldwide) on migration from SIEM API to Graph Security API for more information.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

This module has used **Microsoft Azure Event Hub** for Streaming Event, **Microsoft Graph Security v1.0 REST API** for Incident and **Microsoft 365 Defender API** for Log data streams.

For **Event**, in filebeat [Azure Event Hub](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-azure-eventhub.html) input, state such as leases on partitions and checkpoints in the event stream are shared between receivers using an Azure Storage container. For this reason, as a prerequisite to using this input, users will have to create or use an existing storage account.

## Compatibility

- Supported Microsoft 365 Defender streaming event types have been supported in the current integration version:

## Setup

### To collect data from Microsoft Azure Event Hub, follow the below steps:
1. [Configure Microsoft 365 Defender to stream Advanced Hunting events to your Azure Event Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/streaming-api-event-hub?view=o365-worldwide).

### To collect data from Microsoft Graph Security v1.0 REST API, follow the below steps:

1. [Register a new Azure Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2?view=graph-rest-1.0).
2. Permission required for accessing Incident API would be **SecurityIncident.Read.All**. See more details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service?view=graph-rest-1.0)
3. After the application has been created, it will generate Client ID, Client Secret and Tenant ID values that are required for alert and incident data collection.

1. [Register a new Azure Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/api-create-app-web?view=o365-worldwide#create-an-app).
2. Permission required for accessing Log API would be **Incident.Read.All**.
3. After the application has been created, it will generate Client ID, Client Secret and Tenant ID values that are required for log data collection.
