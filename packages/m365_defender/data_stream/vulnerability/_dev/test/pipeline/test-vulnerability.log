The issue is due to improper input validation of user-supplied data, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or crash the system. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the targeted system. Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the affected system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially take control of the system. Additionally, a successful attack could cause a denial of service condition, rendering the system unavailable to legitimate users.
