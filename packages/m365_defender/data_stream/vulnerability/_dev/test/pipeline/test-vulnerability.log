{"id":"TVM-2020-0002","name":"TVM-2020-0002","description":"Summary: The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The issue is due to improper input validation of user-supplied data, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or crash the system. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the targeted system. Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the affected system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially take control of the system. Additionally, a successful attack could cause a denial of service condition, rendering the system unavailable to legitimate users. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.

{"id":"CVE-2025-3074","name":"CVE-2025-3074","description":"Summary: The vulnerability in Google Chrome prior to version 135.0.7049.52 allows a remote attacker to perform UI spoofing by exploiting an inappropriate implementation in the Downloads feature. By crafting a malicious HTML page, the attacker can deceive users into thinking they are interacting with a legitimate interface. This vulnerability has a low severity rating according to Chromiums security assessment. Impact: If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could lead to UI spoofing, where users may unknowingly interact with a fake interface. This can result in various malicious activities, such as tricking users into downloading malware or disclosing sensitive information. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and has been addressed in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) since it incorporates Chromiums fixes. For more details, refer to the Google Chrome Releases page. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors.
