# NGINX OTEL

The Nginx integration allows you to monitor [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) servers. Time series [index mode](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tsds.html) enabled for metrics data stream.

Use the Nginx integration to collect metrics and logs from your server.

## Setup

To load the dashboards in this Integration, the OTEL metrics should be coming in from OTEL [NGINX Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/nginxreceiver/README.md).

### NGINX Setup
The Nginx `stubstatus` stream collects data from the Nginx `ngx_http_stub_status` module. It scrapes the server status
data from the web page generated by `ngx_http_stub_status`. Please verify that your Nginx distribution comes with the mentioned
module and it's enabled in the Nginx configuration file:

```
location /nginx_status {
    stub_status;
    allow 127.0.0.1; # only allow requests from localhost
    deny all;        # deny all other hosts
}
```

Replace `127.0.0.1` with your serverâ€™s IP address and make sure that this page accessible to only you.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
