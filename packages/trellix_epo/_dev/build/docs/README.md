# Trellix ePO

## Overview

The [Trellix ePO](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/products/epo.html) integration allows users to monitor devices, events and groups. Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator is centralized security management platform to orchestrate and manage all your endpoints.

Use the Trellix ePO integration to collect and parse data from the REST APIs. Then visualize that data in Kibana.

## Data streams

The Trellix ePO integration collects three types of data: devices, events and groups.

**Devices** fetch all devices.

**Events** fetch all events.

**Groups** fetch all groups.

## Requirements

Elasticsearch is needed to store and search data. Kibana is needed for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your hardware.

This module has been tested against **Trellix ePO API Version v2**.
