# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a fully-managed platform that empowers you to build, deploy and operate intelligent agents using any framework or foundation model, while eliminating the burden of managing agent infrastructure. It is composed of modular capabilities such as Runtime, Gateway, Memory, Identity, Observability, Code Interpreter, and Browser Tool—enabling you to focus on crafting the agent workflows that interact with your systems and data.

The Amazon Bedrock AgentCore integration enables seamless monitoring of your intelligent agents by collecting comprehensive runtime metrics and observability data. This integration provides visibility into agent execution activity, performance metrics, resource utilization, error rates, and operational insights essential for maintaining optimal agent performance.


**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

### Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore CloudWatch metrics and supports the AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore namespace for comprehensive observability data collection.

## What data does this integration collect?

The Amazon Bedrock AgentCore integration collects runtime metrics and observability data from your intelligent agents.

Data streams:
 - `metrics`: Collects Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime metrics including invocations, sessions, latency, performance indicators, error rates, throttling metrics, token counts, target execution metrics, and authorization metrics from the following AgentCore components: Agent runtime, Gateways, Memory, and Identity.

## What do I need to use this integration?

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any Amazon Bedrock AgentCore integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, check the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

* Elastic Agent must be installed. For detailed guidance, follow these [instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).
* You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
* Elastic Agent is required to collect metrics from CloudWatch and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed through the integration's ingest pipelines.

## Setup

To use the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore metrics, ensure your agents are deployed and running. The integration will automatically collect metrics from the AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore CloudWatch namespace. For enhanced observability, enable detailed monitoring and logging for your AgentCore resources.

For more details about enabling observability for AgentCore, check the [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-runtime-metrics.html).

## Metrics

### Runtime Metrics

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime metrics provide comprehensive visibility into your agent execution and performance. The integration collects the following categories of metrics:

These metrics enable several use cases, such as:
- Monitoring agent performance and response times
- Tracking resource consumption for cost optimization
- Identifying and troubleshooting error patterns
- Analyzing agent usage patterns and scaling requirements
- Monitoring authorization and access control effectiveness

**Dimensions:**

The metrics include the following dimensions for enhanced filtering and analysis:
- `Operation`: The operation name performed by the agent
- `Resource`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent resource
- `AgentId`: The unique identifier of the agent
- `EndpointName`: The name of the agent endpoint
- `SessionId`: The session identifier for agent invocations

An example event for `metrics` looks as following:
