This can impact agent\n// performance and user experience.\n//\n// Common causes of throttling:\n// - High request volume exceeding service quotas\n// - Burst traffic patterns\n// - Insufficient provisioned capacity\n//\n// The alert is grouped by cloud account, region, and resource to identify\n// which gateways are being throttled.\n//\n// To reduce alert noise, increase the threshold (e.g., `total_throttles > 10`).\n// Consider requesting a service quota increase if sustained throttling occurs.\n// For more details, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-gateway-metrics.html\n\nFROM metrics-aws_bedrock_agentcore.metrics-*\n| WHERE aws.dimensions.Operation == \"InvokeGateway\"\n| STATS total_throttles = sum(aws.bedrock_agentcore.metrics.Throttles.sum) BY cloud.account.id, cloud.region, aws.dimensions.Resource\n| WHERE total_throttles > 0"
