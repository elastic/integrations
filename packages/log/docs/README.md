# Custom Logs Package

The **Custom Logs** package is used to ingest arbitrary log files and parse their contents using [Ingest Pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html). Follow the steps below to set up and use this package.

## Get started

1. **Install Elastic Agent**
   Install an [Elastic Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html) on the machine from which you want to collect logs.

2. **Identify the Log Location**
   Identify the log location on that machine, for example, `/tmp/custom.log`.
   - If you need to include multiple log files or an entire directory, consider using wildcard patterns such as `/tmp/*.log` to capture all `.log` files, or `/tmp/*` to include all file types.
   - Note that the [System integration](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/system) ingests `/var/log/*.log`. You do not need to add this path if the System integration is in use.

3. **Enroll the Custom Logs Integration**
   - Add the **Custom Logs** integration to your installed Elastic Agent.
   - Provide an Integration name. A descriptive name will make managing this integration in the Kibana UI more intuitive.
   - Configure the path to match the location(s) identified in the previous step.
   - Provide a dataset name that reflects the purpose of your logs (for example, `python` for Python application logs).

4. **Verify Data in Discover**
   - Open [Discover](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html) in Kibana and filter the `logs-*` indices to your dataset name (e.g., `logs-python`) to confirm that the raw log data is being ingested.

5. **Configure Parsing Rules**
   - Use [Ingest Pipelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html) to define parsing rules.
   - See [Parse and route logs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/observability-parse-log-data.html) for examples of how to extract structured fields and reroute log data to specific data streams.

6. **Create a Custom Dashboard**
   - Use [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/create-a-dashboard-of-panels-with-web-server-data.html) to build a dashboard for analyzing incoming log data based on your specific needs.

## ECS Field Mapping

This integration includes an ECS Dynamic Template, so any fields following the [ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) schema will automatically receive the correct index field mappings without additional manual configuration.
