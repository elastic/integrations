# Custom Logs input for Elastic based on the OTel Collector

## Overview

The Custom Logs input for Elastic based on the OTel Collector collects
logs from files using the [File Log
Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/filelogreceiver/README.md)
of the OTel Collector.

This integration can be used to collect logs from files.

### How it works

This integration tails and parses logs from files. Observed files are the ones
matching the configured patterns.

## What data does this integration collect?


Key fields are stored following [Semantic Conventions for logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/logs/), among them:
| Field Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| message | Collected log line. |
| log.file.name | File name. |
| log.file.path | File path. |

### Supported use cases

This integration can be used to collect custom log files.

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to have permissions to read the monitored files.



### Onboard / configure

This integration needs to be configured with the glob patterns of the files to
collect.

### Validation

Once configured, you can find documents with the content of the collected log files.

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).


## Scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

### Inputs used

This package uses the [File Log Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/filelogreceiver/README.md) of the OTel Collector.
