# Kubelet Stats OpenTelemetry Input Package

## Overview

The Kubelet Stats OpenTelemetry Input Package for Elastic enables collection of Kubernetes node, pod, container, and volume metrics from the Kubelet API using the [kubeletstatsreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kubeletstatsreceiver).

### How it works

This package configures the Kubelet Stats receiver in the EDOT (Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry) collector to scrape metrics from the Kubelet API. The Elastic Agent processes and enriches the data before sending it to Elasticsearch for indexing and analysis. Once the data arrives into Elasticsearch, its corresponding [Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Assets Package](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/integrations/kubernetes_otel) gets auto installed and the dashboards light up.

## Configuration

For the full list of settings exposed for the receiver and exampples, refer to the [configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kubeletstatsreceiver#configuration) section.

## Reference

### Metrics Reference

For a complete list of all available metrics and their detailed descriptions, refer to the [Kubelet Stats Receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/kubeletstatsreceiver/documentation.md) in the upstream OpenTelemetry Collector repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection refused errors:**
- Verify the Kubelet endpoint is accessible from the collector.
- Check that the correct port is being used (10250 for secure, 10255 for read-only).
- Ensure RBAC permissions are correctly configured.

**Certificate errors:**
- When using TLS auth, verify certificate paths are correct.
- Consider enabling `insecure_skip_verify` for testing (not recommended for production).
- Ensure the CA file matches the Kubelet's certificate.

**Empty metrics:**
- Verify `metric_groups` includes the desired metric types.
- Check Kubelet logs for any errors.
- Ensure the node name is correctly configured if using node utilization metrics.
