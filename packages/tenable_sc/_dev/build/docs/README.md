# Tenable.sc

The Tenable.sc integration collects and parses data from the [Tenable.sc](https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/Welcome.htm) APIs.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against `Tenable.sc version 5.18`

## Requirements

In order to ingest data from the Tenable.sc you must have the **Access key** and **Secret Key**.

Enable API keys to allow users to perform API key authentication. 

See Tenable's documentation for more information on: 

* [Enabling API Key Authentication](https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/EnableAPIKeys.htm) 
* [Generating API keys]( https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/GenerateAPIKey.htm)

>  Note: The default value is the recommended value for a batch size by Tenable. It can be found under _Advanced Options_ and can be configured as per requirements. A very large value might not work as intended depending on the API and instance limitations.
