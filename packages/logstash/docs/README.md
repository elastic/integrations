# Logstash

The `logstash` package collects metrics and logs of Logstash.

## Compatibility

The `logstash` package works with Logstash 8.5.0 and later

## Technical Preview note

This Logstash package also includes a technical preview of Logstash data collection and dashboards
native to elastic agent. The technical preview includes enhanced data collection, and a number of dashboards, which include additional insight into running pipelines.

Note that this feature is not intended for use with the Stack Monitoring UI inside Kibana,
and is included as a technical preview. Existing implementations wishing to continue using the Stack Monitoring UI should uncheck the technical preview option, and continue to use `Metrics (Stack Monitoring)`. Those users who wish to use the technical preview should uncheck `Metrics (Stack Monitoring)` and check `Metrics (Technical Preview)`


## Logs

Logstash package supports the plain text format and the JSON format. Also, two types of 
logs can be activated with the Logstash package:

* `log` collects and parses the logs that Logstash writes to disk.
* `slowlog` parses the logstash slowlog (make sure to configure the Logstash slowlog option).

#### Known issues

When using the `log` data stream to parse plaintext logs, if a multiline plaintext log contains an embedded JSON object such that
the JSON object starts on a new line, the fileset may not parse the multiline plaintext log event correctly.


## Metrics

Logstash metric related data streams works with Logstash 7.3.0 and later.

### Node Stats

An example event for `node_stats` looks as following:

```json

## Metrics (Technical Preview)

This Logstash package also includes a technical preview of Logstash data collection and dashboards
native to elastic agent. The technical preview includes enhanced data collection, and a number of dashboards, which include additional insight into running pipelines.

Note that this feature is not intended for use with the Stack Monitoring UI inside Kibana,
and is included as a technical preview. Existing implementations wishing to continue using the Stack Monitoring UI should uncheck the technical preview option, and continue to use `Metrics (Stack Monitoring)`. Those users who wish to use the technical preview should uncheck `Metrics (Stack Monitoring)` and check `Metrics (Technical Preview)`

### Fields and Sample Event

| cloud.project.id | The cloud project identifier. Examples: Google Cloud Project id, Azure Project id. | keyword |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |
| cluster_uuid |  | alias |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |  |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |  |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |  |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |  |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |  |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |  |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |  |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |  |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |  |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |  |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |  |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | match_only_text |  |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |  |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |  |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |  |

| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |  |
| service.hostname | Hostname of the service | keyword |  |
| service.id | Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes. This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event. Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead. | keyword |  |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |  |
| service.type | The type of the service data is collected from. The type can be used to group and correlate logs and metrics from one service type. Example: If logs or metrics are collected from Elasticsearch, `service.type` would be `elasticsearch`. | keyword |  |
| service.version | Version of the service the data was collected from. This allows to look at a data set only for a specific version of a service. | keyword |  |

#### Pipeline

This is the `pipeline` dataset, which drives the Pipeline dashboard pages.

#### Example

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.project.id | The cloud project identifier. Examples: Google Cloud Project id, Azure Project id. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| cluster_uuid |  | alias |  |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |  |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |  |  |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |  |  |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |  |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |  |  |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |  |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |  |  |

#### Plugin

This is the `plugin` dataset, which drives the Pipeline detail dashboard pages. Note that this dataset may produce many documents for logstash instances using a large number of pipelines and/or plugins within those pipelines. For those instances, we recommend reviewing the
pipeline collection period, and setting it to an appropriate value.

#### Example

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.project.id | The cloud project identifier. Examples: Google Cloud Project id, Azure Project id. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| cluster_uuid |  | alias |  |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |  |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |  |  |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |  |  |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |  |  |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |  |  |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |  |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |  |  |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |  |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |  |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |  |  |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |  |  |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |  |  |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |  |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | match_only_text |  |  |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |  |  |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |  |  |
