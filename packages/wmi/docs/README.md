# Custom WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) input package

The Custom WMI Input integration reads metrics via [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi) (WMI), a core management technology in the Windows operating system.
By leveraging WMI Query Language (WQL), this integration allows you to extract detailed system information and metrics to monitor the health and performance of Windows systems.

This input leverages the [Microsoft WMI](https://github.com/microsoft/wmi) library, a convenient wrapper around the [GO-OLE](https://github.com/go-ole) library which allows to invoke the WMI API.

## Requirements

This integration requires Elastic-Agent 8.19.0 or 9.1.0 and above.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested on the following platforms:

| Operating System                            | Architecture |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Datacenter    | x64          |
| Microsoft Windows 11 Pro                    | x64          |


## WMI Query Language (WQL) support

This integration supports the execution of
[WQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wql-sql-for-wmi)
queries, a SQL-like query language for retrieving information from WMI
namespaces.

Currently, this input package supports queries with `SELECT`, `FROM` and
`WHERE` clauses.

**Warning**:
When working with WMI queries, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure
that queries are safe, efficient, and do not cause unintended side
effects. A notorious example of a problematic WMI class is
`Win32_Product`. Read more in the related [Windows
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/admin-development/windows-installer-reconfigured-all-applications#more-information_).

##  WMI arbitrator and query execution

Query execution is managed by the underlying WMI framework, specifically
by the [WMI
arbitrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/new-wmi-arbitrator-behavior-in-windows-server).
The arbitrator is responsible for:

- Scheduling and controlling query execution

- Throttling or stopping queries based on system resource availability
  and conditions

There is no way to directly stop a query once it has started. To prevent
Elastic Agent from waiting indefinitely for a query to return a result or
fail, Elastic Agent has a timeout mechanism that stops waiting for query
results after a specified timeout. This is controlled by the
`wmi.warning_threshold` setting.

**Note**: While Elastic Agent stops waiting for the result, the underlying WMI query
may continue running until the WMI arbitrator decides to stop execution.



## WMI type support

The `microsoft/wmi` library internally uses the WMI Scripting API. This API, as per the
[official WMI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/querying-wmi),
does not provide direct type conversion for `uint64`, `sint64`, and `datetime`
[Common Information Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/common-information-model) (CIM) types;
instead, these values are returned as strings.

To ensure the correct data type is reported, Elastic Agent dynamically fetches the
CIM type definitions for the properties of the WMI instance classes returned by the query,
and then performs the necessary data type conversions.

To optimize performance and avoid repeatedly fetching these schema definitions
for every row and every request, an LRU cache is utilized. This cache stores
the schema definition for each WMI class-property pair encountered. For queries involving
superclasses, such as `CIM_LogicalDevice`, the cache will populate with individual entries
for each specific derived class (leaf of the class hierarchy) whose instances are returned by the query (for example, `Win32_DiskDrive` or `Win32_NetworkAdapter`).

**Note**:
The properties of type `CIM_Object` (embedded objects) are not yet supported and are ignored.


**Note**:
The properties of type `CIM_Reference` (references) used in [WMI Association Classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/declaring-an-association-class) are currently returned as strings as reported by the microsoft/wmi library.



##  Date fields mapping

Elastic Agent converts WMI properties of type "datetime" to timestamps, but these are serialized as strings in the output. Since date detection is disabled by default, these fields will be stored as strings unless explicitly mapped as dates. To ensure proper mapping, we recommend explicitly setting the mapping in the `@custom` template.

results should be returned without a row limit. | `0` |
| `wmi.schema_cache_size`    | The maximum number of WMI class-property pairs that can be cached per single query. Every query keeps its own separate cache. This cache helps improve performance when dealing with queries that involve inheritance hierarchies. Read more in [WMI type support](#wmi-type-support).<br>For example, if a superclass is queried, the cache stores entries for each WMI concrete instance class (the leaves of the class hierarchy) and their associated properties. Therefore, querying a superclass that returns a result set containing instances of `10` different classes, each with `50` properties, will result in a cache size of `500` entries (`10×50`). | `1000` |
| `wmi.queries`                     | The list of queries to execute. The list cannot be empty.

| `properties`| List of properties to return. Specifies the `SELECT` clause. Set to an empty list (default) to retrieve all available properties.                                                                      | Default: empty list     |
| `where`     | The `WHERE` clause. Read more about the format in the related [Windows documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/where-clause).                                                    | Optional                |
| `namespace` | The WMI namespace for this query (overrides the global `namespace` value for this query).                                                                                                                        | Optional                |

### Example

Example WQL query:

```sql
SELECT Name, ProcessId, WorkingSetSize
FROM Win32_Process
WHERE Name = 'lsass.exe' AND WorkingSetSize > 104857600
```

Equivalent YAML configuration:

```yaml
- class: Win32_Process
  properties:
  - Name
  - ProcessId
  - WorkingSetSize
  where: "Name = 'lsass.exe' AND WorkingSetSize > 104857600"
```
