# ForgeRock Identity Platform

ForgeRock is a modern identity platform which helps organizations radically simplify identity and access management (IAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA). The ForgeRock integration collects audit logs from the [API](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488).

### Configuration

Authorization parameters for the ForgeRock Identity Cloud API (`API Key ID`, and `API Key Secret`) can be created [in the Identity Cloud admin UI](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/developer-docs/authenticate-to-rest-api-with-api-key-and-secret.html#get_an_api_key_and_secret). 

## Logs

### AM_Access events

This is the `forgerock.am_access` dataset. These logs capture all incoming Identity Cloud access calls as audit events. This includes who, what, when, and the output for every access request. More information about [these logs](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488#am-access).

An example event for `am_access` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2022-11-06T18:16:43.813Z",
    "agent": {

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| client.domain | The domain name of the client system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| client.ip | IP address of the client (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| client.port | Port of the client. | long |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If `event.start` and `event.end` are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| forgerock.eventName | The name of the audit event. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers | The headers of the HTTP request. | object |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.accept | The accept parameter for the request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.accept-api-version | The accept-api-version header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.content-type | The content-type header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.host | The host header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.origin | The origin header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.user-agent | The user-agent header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.x-forwarded-for | The x-forwarded-for header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.x-forwarded-proto | The x-forwaded-proto header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.headers.x-requested-with | The x-requested with header of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| forgerock.http.request.queryParameters | The query parameter string of the HTTP request. | object |
| forgerock.http.request.secure | A flag describing whether or not the HTTP request was secure. | boolean |
| forgerock.level | The log level. | keyword |
| forgerock.objectId | Specifies the identifier of an object that has been created, updated, or deleted. | keyword |
| forgerock.realm | The realm where the operation occurred. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.detail | Details around the response status. | object |
| forgerock.request.detail.action | Details around the request action. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.detail.grant_type | The request's grant type. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.detail.scope | The request's scope. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.detail.token_type_hint | The request's token type. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.operation | The request operation. | keyword |
| forgerock.request.protocol | The protocol associated with the request; REST or PLL. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.detail | Details around the response status. | object |
| forgerock.response.detail.active | A flag for whether or not the response was active. | boolean |
| forgerock.response.detail.client_id | The responses's client id. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.detail.revision | The responses's revision. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.detail.scope | The responses's scope. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.detail.token_type | The responses's token type. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.detail.username | The responses's username. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.elapsedTime | Time to execute event. | date |
| forgerock.response.elapsedTimeUnits | Units for response time. | keyword |
| forgerock.response.status | Status indicator, usually SUCCESS/SUCCESSFUL or FAIL/FAILED. | keyword |
| forgerock.roles | IDM roles associated with the request. | keyword |
| forgerock.source | The source of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.topic | The topic of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.trackingIds | Specifies a unique random string generated as an alias for each AM session ID and OAuth 2.0 token. | keyword |
| http.request.Path | The path of the HTTP request. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| http.response.body.content | The full HTTP response body. | wildcard |
| http.response.body.content.text | Multi-field of `http.response.body.content`. | match_only_text |
| http.response.status_code | HTTP response status code. | long |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| transaction.id | Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace. A transaction is the highest level of work measured within a service, such as a request to a server. | keyword |
| user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| forgerock.entries | The JSON representation of the details of an authentication module, chain, tree, or node. | flattened |
| forgerock.eventName | The name of the audit event. | keyword |
| forgerock.level | The log level. | keyword |
| forgerock.principal | The array of accounts used to authenticate. | keyword |
| forgerock.realm | The realm where the operation occurred. | keyword |
| forgerock.source | The source of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.topic | The topic of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.trackingIds | Specifies a unique random string generated as an alias for each AM session ID and OAuth 2.0 token. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| transaction.id | Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace. A transaction is the highest level of work measured within a service, such as a request to a server. | keyword |
| user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |


### AM_Config events

This is the `forgerock.am_config` dataset. These logs capture access management configuration changes for Identity Cloud with a timestamp and by whom. More information about [these logs](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488#am-config).

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |

| error.stack_trace | The stack trace of this error in plain text. | wildcard |
| error.stack_trace.text | Multi-field of `error.stack_trace`. | match_only_text |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| forgerock.action | The synchronization action, depicted as a Common REST action. | keyword |
| forgerock.eventName | The name of the audit event. | keyword |
| forgerock.level | The log level. | keyword |
| forgerock.linkQualifier | ForgeRock's link qualifier applied to the action. | keyword |
| forgerock.mapping | Name of the mapping used for the synchronization operation. | keyword |
| forgerock.situation | The synchronization situation as documented https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/7.2/synchronization-guide/chap-situations-actions.html#sync-situations | keyword |
| forgerock.source | The source of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.sourceObjectId | Object ID on the source system. | keyword |
| forgerock.targetObjectId | Object ID on the target system | keyword |
| forgerock.topic | The topic of the event. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| transaction.id | Unique identifier of the transaction within the scope of its trace. A transaction is the highest level of work measured within a service, such as a request to a server. | keyword |
| user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
