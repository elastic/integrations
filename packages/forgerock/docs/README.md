# ForgeRock Identity Platform

ForgeRock is a modern identity platform which helps organizations radically simplify identity and access management (IAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA). The ForgeRock integration collects audit logs from the [API](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488).

### Configuration

Authorization parameters for the ForgeRock Identity Cloud API (`API Key ID`, and `API Key Secret`) can be created [in the Identity Cloud admin UI](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/developer-docs/authenticate-to-rest-api-with-api-key-and-secret.html#get_an_api_key_and_secret). 

## Logs

### AM_Access events

This is the `forgerock.am_access` dataset. These logs capture all incoming Identity Cloud access calls as audit events. This includes who, what, when, and the output for every access request. More information about [these logs](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488#am-access).

An example event for `am_access` looks as following:

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| forgerock.entries | The JSON representation of the details of an authentication module, chain, tree, or node. | flattened |
| forgerock.eventName | The name of the audit event. | keyword |
| forgerock.level | The log level. | keyword |
| forgerock.method | The authentication method, such as `JWT` or `MANAGED_USER`. | keyword |
| forgerock.principal | The array of accounts used to authenticate. | keyword |
| forgerock.result | Status indicator, usually SUCCESS/SUCCESSFUL or FAIL/FAILED. | keyword |
| forgerock.topic | The topic of the event. | keyword |
| forgerock.trackingIds | Specifies a unique random string generated as an alias for each AM session ID and OAuth 2.0 token. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |


### IDM_config events

This is the `forgerock.idm_config` dataset. These logs capture configuration changes to Identity Cloud with a timestamp and by whom. More information about [these logs](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a37739488#idm-config).
