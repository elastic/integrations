# Trellix ePO On-Prem Integration for Elastic

## Overview

[Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) On-Prem](https://www.trellix.com/products/epolicy-orchestrator/) is a centralized security management platform for managing endpoint policies, products, systems, and security events across an organization. Its Web Control component logs web browsing activity together with the content and reputation ratings applied to each visited URL — combining user browsing behavior, category classification, and phishing/spam/exploit/download risk ratings into a unified platform for **web usage monitoring and threat visibility**.

The Trellix ePO On-Prem integration for Elastic collects web control logs using the **Web API** via CEL input, and visualizes them in Kibana.

### Compatibility

The Trellix ePO On-Prem integration is compatible with **Trellix ePO On-Prem 5.10.0 and above** with Web API support enabled.

### How it works

This integration uses the Elastic Agent CEL input to poll the Trellix ePO Web API at configurable intervals. It retrieves web control event records from the `WP_EventInfo` table. Because `WP_EventInfo` has no timestamp column, the integration paginates using a keyset cursor on the numeric `EventAutoID` field instead of a time-based cursor: each poll requests events with `EventAutoID` greater than the last persisted value, orders results ascending by `EventAutoID`, and persists the highest `EventAutoID` returned for the next poll, ensuring efficient, non-blocking retrieval without missing or duplicating records. Each web control event is mapped to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for standardized field naming and ingested as an individual event for enrichment by the built-in ingest pipeline.

## What data does this integration collect?

The Trellix ePO On-Prem integration collects the following types of data:

| Data stream | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `web_control` | Trellix ePO web control event records, including browsed URLs, user names, content/category ratings (phishing, spam, download, exploit, bad-link, pop-up), overall rating, list/reason/action identifiers, and per-event counts, retrieved from the ePO Web API. | `/remote/core.executeQuery` API |

### Supported use cases

Integrating Trellix ePO Web Control with Elastic provides centralized visibility into user web browsing activity and the ratings/categories Web Control applies to that traffic, enabling web usage monitoring, threat and risk investigation (phishing, spam, exploit, malicious downloads), and policy-violation reporting within Kibana dashboards.

## What do I need to use this integration?

### From Trellix ePO On-Prem

To collect data via the Web API, you need the following:

1. **Trellix ePO server**: Trellix ePO On-Prem 5.10.0 or above with Web API support enabled.
2. **User account**: A Trellix ePO user account with:
   - **Query permissions** to the `WP_EventInfo` table.
   - Sufficient role permissions to execute queries through the Web API.
3. **API credentials**: Username and password for HTTP Basic authentication.
4. **Server URL**: Base URL of the Trellix ePO server, for example `https://epo.example.com:8443`.
5. **Network access**: The Elastic Agent must have outbound HTTPS access to the ePO server.

For more information on configuring Web API access in Trellix ePO, refer to the [Trellix ePO Web API Scripting Reference Guide](https://docs.trellix.com/bundle/trellix-epolicy-orchestrator-on-prem-web-api-scripting-reference-guide/page/UUID-8df5c181-2be6-8b3e-f562-e5b292a385ca.html).

## How do I deploy this integration?

This integration supports both Elastic Agentless-based and Agent-based installations.

### Agentless-based installation

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

### Agent-based installation

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

### Configure

1. In the top search bar in Kibana, search for **Integrations**.
2. In the search bar, type **Trellix ePO On-Prem**.
3. Select the **Trellix ePO On-Prem** integration from the search results.
4. Select **Add Trellix ePO On-Prem** to add the integration.
5. Enable and configure the **Collect Trellix ePO Logs** collection method.

   - Set **Trellix ePO URL** to the base URL of your Trellix ePO server, for example `https://epo.example.com:8443`.
   - Set **Username** for the ePO user account with `WP_EventInfo` query permissions.
   - Set **Password** for the ePO user account.
   - Set **Initial Event Auto Id** to the starting `EventAutoID` from which to begin querying events. Subsequent collections resume from the last persisted `EventAutoID`. Set to `0` to start from the beginning (default: `0`).
   - Set **Interval** to the polling frequency. The default is `24h`.
   - Set **Page Size** to the number of web control log records to retrieve API request. The default is `500`.
   - Optionally adjust **HTTP Client Timeout**, proxy, and SSL settings.

6. Select **Save and continue** to save the integration.

## Troubleshooting

* **No data collected**: Verify that the Trellix ePO API URL is correct, credentials are valid, and the Elastic Agent has network access to the ePO server. Check that the user account has permissions to query the `WP_EventInfo` table.
* **Authentication failures**: Ensure the username and password are correct and the user account has not been locked or disabled in Trellix ePO. Verify the account has sufficient permissions to access the `WP_EventInfo` table.
* **Incomplete or missing fields**: Confirm that the ePO user account has sufficient permissions to access all `WP_EventInfo` columns configured in the integration (select clause in the CEL template).
* **Pagination issues**: If web control logs are not advancing beyond the initial set, verify that `EventAutoID` values are strictly increasing in the source table and that the persisted `EventAutoID` cursor is being correctly updated between polls.
* **SSL certificate errors**: If your Trellix ePO server uses a self-signed certificate, extract the certificate and configure it under the SSL settings of the integration, or add it to the Elastic Agent's trusted certificate store.
* **Network connectivity issues**: Verify firewall rules allow outbound HTTPS traffic from the Elastic Agent host to the Trellix ePO server on the configured port.

### Inputs used

These inputs are used in the integration:

- [CEL](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/beats/filebeat/filebeat-input-cel)

### API usage

This integration uses the following API:

* **Web Control**: Collects web control event records via the **Trellix ePO executeQuery API** (endpoint: `/remote/core.executeQuery`). Records are queried from the `WP_EventInfo` table using keyset-based pagination with the `EventAutoID` field as a cursor to ensure efficient and non-duplicating retrieval.
