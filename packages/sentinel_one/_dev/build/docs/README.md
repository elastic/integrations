# SentinelOne

The [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) integration collects and parses data from SentinelOne REST APIs. This integration also offers the capability to perform response actions on SentinelOne hosts directly through the Elastic Security interface (introduced with v8.12.0). Additional configuration is required; for detailed guidance, refer to [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/response-actions-config.html).

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against `SentinelOne Management Console API version 2.1`.

## API token

To collect data from SentinelOne APIs, you must have an API token. To create an API token, follow these steps:

  1. Log in to the **SentinelOne Management Console** as an **Admin**.

  2. Navigate to **Logged User Account** from top right panel in the navigation bar.
  3. Click **My User**.
  4. In the API token section, click **Generate**.

## Note

The API token generated by the user is time-limited. To rotate a new token, log in with the dedicated admin account.
