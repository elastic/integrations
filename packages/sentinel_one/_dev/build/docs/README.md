# SentinelOne

The [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) integration collects and parses data from SentinelOne REST APIs. This integration also offers the capability to perform response actions on SentinelOne hosts directly through the Elastic Security interface (introduced with v8.12.0). Additional configuration is required; for detailed guidance, refer to [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/response-actions-config.html).

## Agentless Enabled Integration
Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against `SentinelOne Management Console API version 2.1`.

## API token

To collect data from SentinelOne APIs, you must have an API token. To create an API token, follow these steps:

  1. Log in to the **SentinelOne Management Console** as an **Admin**.
  ![SentinelOne dashboards](../img/sentinel-one-dashboard.png)
  2. Navigate to **Logged User Account** from top right panel in the navigation bar.
  3. Click **My User**.
  4. In the API token section, click **Generate**.

## Note

The API token generated by the user is time-limited. To rotate a new token, log in with the dedicated admin account.

The **alert** data stream depends on STAR Custom Rules. STAR Custom Rules are supported in Cloud environments, but are not supported in on-premises environments. Because of this, the **alert** data stream is not supported in on-premises environments.

## Alert severity mapping

The values used in `event.severity` are consistent with Elastic Detection Rules.

| Severity Name | `event.severity` |
|---------------|:----------------:|
| Low           | 21               |
| Medium        | 47               |
| High          | 73               |
| Critical      | 99               |
