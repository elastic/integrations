# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

This integration is for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint?view=o365-worldwide) logs.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration collects data for Alert, Machine, and Machine Action logs using REST API.

## Data streams

This integration collects the following logs:

- **[Alert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/api/get-alerts?view=o365-worldwide)** - Retrieves alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **[Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/api/get-machines?view=o365-worldwide)** - Retrieves machines that have communicated with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- **[Machine Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/api/get-machineactions-collection?view=o365-worldwide)** - Retrieves logs of actions carried out on machines.

## Requirements

### Agentless enabled integration
Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments.  This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

### Agent-based installation

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

## Setup

### Collect logs through REST API

To allow the integration to ingest data from the Microsoft Defender API, you need to create a new application on your Azure domain. The procedure to create an application is found on the [Create a new Azure Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/exposed-apis-create-app-webapp) documentation page.

When the application is granted the API permissions listed in the table below, it will receive only the necessary access to collect logs nothing more within the Azure domain.

| Data stream    | API Permissions  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Alert          | Alert.Read.All   |
| Machine        | Machine.Read.All |
| Machine Action | Machine.Read.All |

After the application has been created, it should contain 3 values that you need to apply to the module configuration.

These values are:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Tenant ID

### Enable the integration in Elastic

1. In Kibana navigate to **Management** > **Integrations**.
2. In the search bar, type **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.
3. Select the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** integration and add it.
4. Add all the required integration configuration parameters, including the Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID to enable data collection.
5. Select "Save and continue" to save the integration.
