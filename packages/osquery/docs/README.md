# OSQuery Integration

This integration executes the [osquery](https://osquery.io/) binary on all the
hosts where elastic-agent in running and it allows you to query the host data
via distributed SQL. The queries can be sent ad-hoc or scheduled to be executed
periodically.

This is a proof of concept for now.
