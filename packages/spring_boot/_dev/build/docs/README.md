# Spring Boot integration

The Spring Boot integration is used to fetch observability data from [Spring Boot Actuator web endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.6.3/actuator-api/htmlsingle/) and ingest it into Elasticsearch.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Spring Boot v2.3.12.

## Requirements

In order to ingest data from Spring Boot:
- You must know the host for Spring Boot application, add that host while configuring the integration package.
- Add default path for jolokia.
- Spring-boot-actuator module provides all Spring Bootâ€™s production-ready features. So add below dependency in `pom.xml` file.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
- For access of jolokia add below dependency in `pom.xml` of Spring Boot Application.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
    <artifactId>jolokia-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
- To expose `HTTP Trace` metrics following class can be used [InMemoryHttpTraceRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.6.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/boot/actuate/trace/http/InMemoryHttpTraceRepository.html).
- To expose `Audit Events` metrics following class can be used [InMemoryAuditEventRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/actuate/audit/InMemoryAuditEventRepository.html).

### Troubleshooting

- If **[Spring Boot] Audit Events panel** does not display older documents after upgrading to ``0.9.0`` or later versions, then this issue can be solved by reindexing the ``Audit Events`` data stream's indices.
- If host.ip is shown conflicted under ``logs-*`` data view, then this issue can be solved by [reindexing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/use-a-data-stream.html#reindex-with-a-data-stream) the ``Audit Events`` data stream's indices. 
- If host.ip is shown conflicted under ``metrics-*`` data view, then this issue can be solved by [reindexing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/use-a-data-stream.html#reindex-with-a-data-stream) the ``Garbage Collector``, ``Memory`` and ``Threading`` data stream's indices.

## Logs

### Audit Events logs

This is the `audit_events` data stream.

- This data stream exposes audit events information for the current application.

{{event "audit_events"}}

{{fields "audit_events"}}

### HTTP Trace logs

This is the `http_trace` data stream.

- This data stream displays HTTP trace information.

{{event "http_trace"}}

{{fields "http_trace"}}

## Metrics

### Memory Metrics

This is the `memory` data stream.

- This data stream gives metrics related to heap and non-heap memory, buffer pool and manager.

{{event "memory"}}

{{fields "memory"}}

### Threading Metrics

This is the `threading` data stream.

- This data stream gives metrics related to thread allocations, monitoring and CPU times.

{{event "threading"}}

{{fields "threading"}}

### GC Metrics

This is the `gc` data stream.

- This data stream gives metrics related to Garbage Collector (GC) Memory.

{{event "gc"}}

{{fields "gc"}}
