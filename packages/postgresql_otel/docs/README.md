# OpenTelemetry Package

Exploratory package to post-process opentelemetry postgresql documents from apm-server. 

Processes opentelemetry documents generated by [apm-server](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/open-telemetry.html) using opentelemetry [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for [postgresql](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/postgresqlreceiver).

## Assumptions
* opentelemetry-collector to provide *service.name* as *postgresql*. The dataset binding is based on it.

## Datastream
Temporary solution until apm-server is enhanced.
* datastream: metrics-apm.app.postgresql-default
* dataset: apm.app.postgresql

## Dummy data stream
This is a dummy data-stream for illustrative purpose only.
