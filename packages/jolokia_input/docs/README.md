# Jolokia input

This input package collects metrics from  [Jolokia agents](https://jolokia.org/reference/html/agents.html)  running on a target JMX server or dedicated proxy server.

The metrics are collected by communicating with a Jolokia HTTP/REST endpoint that exposes the JMX metrics over HTTP/REST/JSON.

## Compatibility

The Jolokia module is tested with Jolokia 1.7.0.
