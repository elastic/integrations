# Citrix Web App Firewall Integration for Elastic

> **Note**: This documentation was generated using AI and should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Overview
The Citrix Web App Firewall integration for Elastic enables you to collect and analyze logs from Citrix ADC and NetScaler appliances. This integration provides visibility into your web application security posture by capturing detailed event data, including security violations, signature matches, and network metadata.

This integration facilitates:
- Threat detection and mitigation: Identify and analyze malicious activity such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow attacks blocked by the WAF engine.
- Compliance and auditing: Maintain a detailed audit trail of all web requests and security events to meet regulatory requirements like PCI-DSS and HIPAA using structured `Common Event Format` (CEF) logs.
- Security posture monitoring: Track the effectiveness of WAF policies by monitoring event outcomes, block rates, and the distribution of attack types across different protected applications.
- Operational troubleshooting: Correlate WAF security events with application performance data to distinguish between legitimate user issues and security-driven request blocks.

### Compatibility
This integration has been tested and verified with the following third-party vendor versions:
- Citrix ADC version 13.1
- NetScaler version 10.0

The integration is designed to work with any Citrix or NetScaler appliance capable of exporting logs in the `Common Event Format` (CEF).

### How it works
This integration collects logs from Citrix appliances by receiving `syslog` data over the network via `TCP` or `UDP`, or by reading logs directly from local files on the system. You'll deploy an Elastic Agent on a host configured as a `syslog` receiver or one that has access to the appliance's log files. The agent processes the incoming data—using the `citrix_waf.log` data stream—and forwards it to the Elastic Stack. For the best parsing results and data fidelity, it's recommended to configure your Citrix appliance to export logs in `Common Event Format` (CEF).

## What data does this integration collect?

The Citrix Web App Firewall integration collects log messages of the following types:
- Citrix WAF logs (via Syslog): Citrix WAF logs transmitted over the network via TCP or UDP, including real-time security violations and signature match events.
- Citrix WAF logs (via File): Citrix WAF logs collected from local files on the system where the Elastic Agent is running.
- Application firewall logs: Detailed records of security violations, blocked requests, and signature matches generated by the WAF engine.
- Security event metadata: Information regarding the specific security check triggered, the action taken (such as block or log), and the severity of the event.
- Network metadata: Source and destination IP addresses, ports, and transport protocols involved in the web transactions.

The integration includes the following data stream:
- `log`: This data stream captures security and audit logs including violations, signature matches, and system events.

### Supported use cases

You can use the Citrix Web App Firewall integration to support various security and operational requirements:
- Threat detection and response: Identify and mitigate web-based attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security violations.
- Security posture assessment: Analyze signature matches and security event metadata to evaluate the effectiveness of WAF policies and identify areas for improvement.
- Compliance and auditing: Store security logs to meet regulatory requirements and provide a verifiable trail of security-related events for audits.
- Traffic analysis: Gain insights into network metadata, including source and destination patterns, to understand application usage and identify potential anomalies.

## What do I need to use this integration?

Before you can collect logs from Citrix Web App Firewall, ensure you meet the following requirements.

You need these Citrix-specific prerequisites:
- Administrative access with full credentials for the Citrix ADC / NetScaler management GUI or CLI.
- An active license for the Citrix Web App Firewall feature installed on your appliance.
- Unrestricted network access between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent on the configured Syslog port, which defaults to `9001` for this integration.
- The ability to create and bind global audit policies to the `APPFW_GLOBAL` bind point.
- A firmware version that supports Common Event Format (CEF) logging.

You need these Elastic prerequisites:
- Elastic Stack version 8.11.0 or later.
- An Elastic Agent installed on a host reachable by the Citrix appliance and enrolled in a Fleet policy.
- The Citrix WAF integration added to the Elastic Agent's policy via Kibana.
- Firewall rules that allow inbound traffic to the Elastic Agent on the specified Syslog port from the Citrix appliance's NSIP or SNIP.

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed on a host that can receive syslog data or access the log files from your Citrix appliance. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the syslog or log file receiver and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Set up steps in Citrix Web App Firewall

You must configure your Citrix NetScaler or ADC appliance to generate logs in Common Event Format (CEF) and send them to the Elastic Agent.

#### Step 1: Enable CEF logging

The integration requires logs in CEF for proper field mapping.

1. Log in to the NetScaler or Citrix ADC management interface.
2. Navigate to **Security > Citrix Web App Firewall > Change Engine Settings**.
3. In the **General Settings** section, locate the **CEF Logging** checkbox.
4. Check **Enable CEF Logging**.
5. (Optional) Check **GeoLocation Logging** if you wish to include geolocation data in the logs.
6. Click **OK** to save.

Alternatively, you can use the command line interface (CLI):
```bash
set appfw settings CEFLogging on
```

#### Step 2: Create a syslog action

Define where the logs should be sent by specifying the Elastic Agent IP address and port.

1. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog**.
2. Click on the **Servers** tab and click **Add**.
3. Configure the following details:
   - **Name**: `Elastic_Syslog_Server`
   - **IP Address**: Enter the IP address of your Elastic Agent (replace with your actual value).
   - **Port**: `9001` (or your configured port).
   - **Transport Type**: Select **UDP** or **TCP**.
   - **Log Level**: Select **ALL**.
4. Click **Create**.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:
```bash
# Replace <Elastic_Agent_IP> with your actual value
add audit syslogAction Elastic_Syslog_Server <Elastic_Agent_IP> -serverPort 9001 -logLevel ALL -transport TCP
```

#### Step 3: Create and bind a syslog policy

1. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog** and go to the **Policies** tab.
2. Click **Add**, name it `Elastic_WAF_Policy`, and select the server created in the previous step.
3. Set the **Expression** to `true`.
4. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog** and select **Global Bindings**.
5. Select **APPFW_GLOBAL** and bind the `Elastic_WAF_Policy` with a priority of `100`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:
```bash
add audit syslogPolicy Elastic_WAF_Policy true Elastic_Syslog_Server
bind audit syslogGlobal -policyName Elastic_WAF_Policy -priority 100 -globalBindType APPFW_GLOBAL
```

   - Ensure the agent is in a `Healthy` or `Online` state.
2. Trigger data flow on the Citrix WAF:
   - Generate web traffic by accessing a web application protected by the Citrix WAF.
   - Simulate a policy violation (e.g., `curl http://<waf_app_ip>/etc/passwd`) to trigger a block or log event.
   - Log in or out of the Citrix management interface to generate administrative audit logs.
3. Check data in Kibana:
   - Navigate to **Analytics > Discover**.
   - Select the `logs-*` data view.
   - Enter the KQL filter `data_stream.dataset : "citrix_waf.log"` and confirm that logs appear with recent timestamps.
   - Verify that fields such as `event.dataset`, `source.ip`, `event.action`, and `message` are populated correctly.
4. Check Dashboards:
   - Navigate to **Analytics > Dashboards**.
   - Search for **Citrix Web App Firewall** to verify the pre-built visualizations are populating with data.

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).

### Common configuration issues

Address common configuration issues using the following guidance:

- **CEF logging disabled**: If logs appear in Kibana as a single unparsed string in the `message` field, verify that CEF logging is enabled in the Citrix WAF engine settings. Without the CEF format, the parser can't identify specific security fields.
- **Global binding missing**: If no logs are arriving at the Elastic Agent, verify the audit policy is bound to the `APPFW_GLOBAL` bind point. Binding to `SYSTEM_GLOBAL` might result in WAF logs being mixed with general system logs or suppressed depending on priority settings.
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure that the `Listen Port` configured in the integration settings (e.g., `9001`) isn't being used by another service on the Elastic Agent host. You can use commands like `netstat -ano` or `ss -tulpn` to verify if the agent is listening on the expected port.
- **Firewall or network ACL blocks**: Verify that any network firewalls between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent permit traffic on the configured UDP or TCP port.
- **Timestamp mismatches**: If logs appear to be missing or have incorrect times, check for a significant time difference between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent. Use the `Timezone` setting in the integration configuration to correct for offset differences.
- **Parsing failures**: Check the `error.message` field in Kibana for messages like "Provided grok patterns did not match". This usually indicates that the Citrix log format isn't standard CEF. Ensure no custom syslog headers are prepended to the CEF payload on the Citrix side.
- **Truncated logs**: If logs are incomplete or missing data, check the `max_message_size` setting in the TCP or UDP options. Large WAF events with many headers can exceed the default `10KiB` limit.

## Performance and scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

To ensure optimal performance in high-volume security environments, you should consider the following configuration and deployment strategies:
- Use TCP for transport to ensure reliable delivery and support for encrypted transport via SSL/TLS. While UDP has lower overhead, it doesn't guarantee delivery in high-volume scenarios.
- Monitor your host's disk I/O performance if you're using the `logfile` input. You'll need to handle sustained write and read loads, and you should implement log rotation to prevent disk exhaustion.
- Check that the `max_message_size` setting is sufficient for your largest Common Event Format (CEF) payloads. The default is `10KiB`, and logs that exceed this size will be truncated.
- Isolate Citrix Web App Firewall specific logs from general system logs by using the `-globalBindType APPFW_GLOBAL` command on your Citrix appliance. This reduces the processing overhead on the Elastic Agent.
- Filter your logs at the source by configuring specific log levels. Focusing your collection on `NOTICE` or higher severity events helps you avoid processing low-value debugging information.
- Scale your deployment by using multiple Elastic Agents behind a network load balancer. It's best to place these agents in close network proximity to your Citrix appliances to minimize latency.
- Allocate sufficient CPU resources to your Elastic Agent hosts. High-velocity CEF data parsing and the use of complex processors can be CPU-intensive.

The `log` data stream provides events from Citrix Web App Firewall of the following types: security violation logs, policy match logs, and system audit logs. It supports logs in both standard syslog format and Common Event Format (CEF).

##### Log fields

The following fields are exported by this data stream:
**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| citrix.cef_format | Whether the logging is in Citrix CEF format. | boolean |
| citrix.cef_version | The CEF format version used in the logs. | keyword |

| citrix.signature_violation_category | The category that the violation is grouped into. | keyword |
| client.address | Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| client.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| client.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| client.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `client.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| client.domain | The domain name of the client system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |

| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |

| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.created | `event.created` contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from `@timestamp` in that `@timestamp` typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, `@timestamp` should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If `event.start` and `event.end` are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | `event.end` contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data is coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.provider | Source of the event. Event transports such as Syslog or the Windows Event Log typically mention the source of an event. It can be the name of the software that generated the event (e.g. Sysmon, httpd), or of a subsystem of the operating system (kernel, Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing). | keyword |
| event.severity | The numeric severity of the event according to your event source. What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source. The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`. | long |
| event.start | `event.start` contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.path.text | Multi-field of `file.path`. | match_only_text |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.id | A unique identifier for each HTTP request to correlate logs between clients and servers in transactions. The id may be contained in a non-standard HTTP header, such as `X-Request-ID` or `X-Correlation-ID`. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type. | keyword |

| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |

| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| server.address | Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| server.domain | The domain name of the server system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |

| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.fragment | Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top". The `#` is not part of the fragment. | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.full.text | Multi-field of `url.full`. | match_only_text |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.password | Password of the request. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (https://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| url.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (https://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.username | Username of the request. | keyword |
| user.email | User email address. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |
