# Citrix Web App Firewall Integration for Elastic

> **Note**: This documentation was generated using AI and should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Overview
The Citrix Web App Firewall integration for Elastic enables you to collect and analyze logs from Citrix ADC and NetScaler appliances. This integration provides visibility into your web application security posture by capturing detailed event data, including security violations, signature matches, and network metadata.

This integration facilitates:
- Threat detection and mitigation: Identify and analyze malicious activity such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow attacks blocked by the WAF engine.
- Compliance and auditing: Maintain a detailed audit trail of all web requests and security events to meet regulatory requirements like PCI-DSS and HIPAA using structured `Common Event Format` (CEF) logs.
- Security posture monitoring: Track the effectiveness of WAF policies by monitoring event outcomes, block rates, and the distribution of attack types across different protected applications.
- Operational troubleshooting: Correlate WAF security events with application performance data to distinguish between legitimate user issues and security-driven request blocks.

### Compatibility
This integration has been tested and verified with the following third-party vendor versions:
- Citrix ADC version 13.1
- NetScaler version 10.0

The integration is designed to work with any Citrix or NetScaler appliance capable of exporting logs in the `Common Event Format` (CEF).

### How it works
This integration collects logs from Citrix appliances by receiving `syslog` data over the network via `TCP` or `UDP`, or by reading logs directly from local files on the system. You'll deploy an Elastic Agent on a host configured as a `syslog` receiver or one that has access to the appliance's log files. The agent processes the incoming data—using the `citrix_waf.log` data stream—and forwards it to the Elastic Stack. For the best parsing results and data fidelity, it's recommended to configure your Citrix appliance to export logs in `Common Event Format` (CEF).

## What data does this integration collect?

The Citrix Web App Firewall integration collects log messages of the following types:
- Citrix WAF logs (via Syslog): Citrix WAF logs transmitted over the network via TCP or UDP, including real-time security violations and signature match events.
- Citrix WAF logs (via File): Citrix WAF logs collected from local files on the system where the Elastic Agent is running.
- Application firewall logs: Detailed records of security violations, blocked requests, and signature matches generated by the WAF engine.
- Security event metadata: Information regarding the specific security check triggered, the action taken (such as block or log), and the severity of the event.
- Network metadata: Source and destination IP addresses, ports, and transport protocols involved in the web transactions.

The integration includes the following data stream:
- `log`: This data stream captures security and audit logs including violations, signature matches, and system events.

### Supported use cases

You can use the Citrix Web App Firewall integration to support various security and operational requirements:
- Threat detection and response: Identify and mitigate web-based attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security violations.
- Security posture assessment: Analyze signature matches and security event metadata to evaluate the effectiveness of WAF policies and identify areas for improvement.
- Compliance and auditing: Store security logs to meet regulatory requirements and provide a verifiable trail of security-related events for audits.
- Traffic analysis: Gain insights into network metadata, including source and destination patterns, to understand application usage and identify potential anomalies.

## What do I need to use this integration?

Before you can collect logs from Citrix Web App Firewall, ensure you meet the following requirements.

You need these Citrix-specific prerequisites:
- Administrative access with full credentials for the Citrix ADC / NetScaler management GUI or CLI.
- An active license for the Citrix Web App Firewall feature installed on your appliance.
- Unrestricted network access between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent on the configured Syslog port, which defaults to `9001` for this integration.
- The ability to create and bind global audit policies to the `APPFW_GLOBAL` bind point.
- A firmware version that supports Common Event Format (CEF) logging.

You need these Elastic prerequisites:
- Elastic Stack version 8.11.0 or later.
- An Elastic Agent installed on a host reachable by the Citrix appliance and enrolled in a Fleet policy.
- The Citrix WAF integration added to the Elastic Agent's policy via Kibana.
- Firewall rules that allow inbound traffic to the Elastic Agent on the specified Syslog port from the Citrix appliance's NSIP or SNIP.

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed on a host that can receive syslog data or access the log files from your Citrix appliance. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the syslog or log file receiver and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Set up steps in Citrix Web App Firewall

You must configure your Citrix NetScaler or ADC appliance to generate logs in Common Event Format (CEF) and send them to the Elastic Agent.

#### Step 1: Enable CEF logging

The integration requires logs in CEF for proper field mapping.

1. Log in to the NetScaler or Citrix ADC management interface.
2. Navigate to **Security > Citrix Web App Firewall > Change Engine Settings**.
3. In the **General Settings** section, locate the **CEF Logging** checkbox.
4. Check **Enable CEF Logging**.
5. (Optional) Check **GeoLocation Logging** if you wish to include geolocation data in the logs.
6. Click **OK** to save.

Alternatively, you can use the command line interface (CLI):
```bash
set appfw settings CEFLogging on
```

#### Step 2: Create a syslog action

Define where the logs should be sent by specifying the Elastic Agent IP address and port.

1. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog**.
2. Click on the **Servers** tab and click **Add**.
3. Configure the following details:
   - **Name**: `Elastic_Syslog_Server`
   - **IP Address**: Enter the IP address of your Elastic Agent (replace with your actual value).
   - **Port**: `9001` (or your configured port).
   - **Transport Type**: Select **UDP** or **TCP**.
   - **Log Level**: Select **ALL**.
4. Click **Create**.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:
```bash
# Replace <Elastic_Agent_IP> with your actual value
add audit syslogAction Elastic_Syslog_Server <Elastic_Agent_IP> -serverPort 9001 -logLevel ALL -transport TCP
```

#### Step 3: Create and bind a syslog policy

1. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog** and go to the **Policies** tab.
2. Click **Add**, name it `Elastic_WAF_Policy`, and select the server created in the previous step.
3. Set the **Expression** to `true`.
4. Navigate to **Configuration > System > Auditing > Syslog** and select **Global Bindings**.
5. Select **APPFW_GLOBAL** and bind the `Elastic_WAF_Policy` with a priority of `100`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:
```bash
add audit syslogPolicy Elastic_WAF_Policy true Elastic_Syslog_Server
bind audit syslogGlobal -policyName Elastic_WAF_Policy -priority 100 -globalBindType APPFW_GLOBAL
```

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).

### Common configuration issues

Address common configuration issues using the following guidance:

- **CEF logging disabled**: If logs appear in Kibana as a single unparsed string in the `message` field, verify that CEF logging is enabled in the Citrix WAF engine settings. Without the CEF format, the parser can't identify specific security fields.
- **Global binding missing**: If no logs are arriving at the Elastic Agent, verify the audit policy is bound to the `APPFW_GLOBAL` bind point. Binding to `SYSTEM_GLOBAL` might result in WAF logs being mixed with general system logs or suppressed depending on priority settings.
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure that the `Listen Port` configured in the integration settings (e.g., `9001`) isn't being used by another service on the Elastic Agent host. You can use commands like `netstat -ano` or `ss -tulpn` to verify if the agent is listening on the expected port.
- **Firewall or network ACL blocks**: Verify that any network firewalls between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent permit traffic on the configured UDP or TCP port.
- **Timestamp mismatches**: If logs appear to be missing or have incorrect times, check for a significant time difference between the Citrix appliance and the Elastic Agent. Use the `Timezone` setting in the integration configuration to correct for offset differences.
- **Parsing failures**: Check the `error.message` field in Kibana for messages like "Provided grok patterns did not match". This usually indicates that the Citrix log format isn't standard CEF. Ensure no custom syslog headers are prepended to the CEF payload on the Citrix side.
- **Truncated logs**: If logs are incomplete or missing data, check the `max_message_size` setting in the TCP or UDP options. Large WAF events with many headers can exceed the default `10KiB` limit.

## Performance and scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

To ensure optimal performance in high-volume security environments, you should consider the following configuration and deployment strategies:
- Use TCP for transport to ensure reliable delivery and support for encrypted transport via SSL/TLS. While UDP has lower overhead, it doesn't guarantee delivery in high-volume scenarios.
- Monitor your host's disk I/O performance if you're using the `logfile` input. You'll need to handle sustained write and read loads, and you should implement log rotation to prevent disk exhaustion.
- Check that the `max_message_size` setting is sufficient for your largest Common Event Format (CEF) payloads. The default is `10KiB`, and logs that exceed this size will be truncated.
- Isolate Citrix Web App Firewall specific logs from general system logs by using the `-globalBindType APPFW_GLOBAL` command on your Citrix appliance. This reduces the processing overhead on the Elastic Agent.
- Filter your logs at the source by configuring specific log levels. Focusing your collection on `NOTICE` or higher severity events helps you avoid processing low-value debugging information.
- Scale your deployment by using multiple Elastic Agents behind a network load balancer. It's best to place these agents in close network proximity to your Citrix appliances to minimize latency.
- Allocate sufficient CPU resources to your Elastic Agent hosts. High-velocity CEF data parsing and the use of complex processors can be CPU-intensive.
