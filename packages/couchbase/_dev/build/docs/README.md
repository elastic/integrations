# Couchbase Integration

## Overview

The Couchbase integration allows you to monitor your Couchbase instance. Couchbase Server is an open-source, distributed multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database software package optimized for interactive applications.

Use the Couchbase integration to collect metrics related to the bucket, cluster, node, and sync gateway. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference logs when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use the data from this integration to know when there are more than some number of failed authentication requests for a single piece of content in a given time period. You could also use the data to troubleshoot the underlying issue by looking at the documents ingested in Elasticsearch.

## Data streams

The Couchbase integration collects metrics data.

Metrics give you insight into the state of the Couchbase. Metrics data streams collected by the Couchbase integration include [Bucket](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-buckets-summary.html), [Cluster](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-cluster-details.html), [Cache](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#cache), [Couchbase Lite Replication](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#cbl_replication_pull), [Database](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#database), [Delta Sync](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#delta_sync), [Eventing](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-monitoring-eventing-service?learningPath=learn/couchbase-monitoring-guide#get-cluster-eventing-service-stats), [GSI views](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#gsi_views), [Import](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#shared_bucket_import), [Index](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-monitoring-index-service#get-cluster-index-service-stats), [Node](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-cluster-details.html), [Query](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-monitoring-query-service?learningPath=learn/couchbase-monitoring-guide#get-cluster-query-service-stats), [Resource Utilization](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#resource_utilization), [Security](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/stats-monitoring.html#security), and [XDCR](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-bucket-stats.html) metrics from [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) so that the user could monitor and troubleshoot the performance of the Couchbase instances.

This integration uses:
- `http` metricbeat module to collect `bucket`, `cluster`, `eventing`, `index`, `query`, and `xdcr` metrics.
- `httpjson` filebeat input to collect `node` metrics.
- `prometheus` metricbeat module to collect `cache`, `cbl_replication`, `database_stats`, `delta_sync`, `gsi_views`, `import`, `resource`, and `security` metrics.

Note: 
- For Couchbase cluster setup, there is an ideal scenario of a single host with administrator access for the entire cluster to collect metrics. Providing multiple hosts from the same cluster might lead to data duplication. In the case of multiple clusters, adding a new integration to collect data from different cluster hosts is a good option.
- For Couchbase `node` metrics, the metrics would be fetched from the first host only and the rest of the hosts will be ignored.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Couchbase `v6.6`, `v7.0`, and `v7.1`.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

In order to ingest data from Couchbase, you must know the host(s) and the administrator credentials for the Couchbase instance(s).

Host Configuration Format: `http[s]://username:password@host:port`

Example Host Configuration: `http://Administrator:password@localhost:8091`

## Setup

In order to collect data using [Sync Gateway](https://www.couchbase.com/products/sync-gateway), follow the steps given below:
- Download and configure [Sync Gateway](https://docs.couchbase.com/sync-gateway/current/get-started-install.html)
- Download and configure [Sync Gateway Promethus Exporter](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-sync-gateway-exporter.git) and provide Sync Gateway Host using --sgw.url flag while running the Exporter App
- Example configuration: `--sgw.url=http://sgw:4985`

## Limitation

For Couchbase `node` metrics, the metrics would be fetched from the first host only and the rest of the hosts will be ignored.

## Metrics reference

### Bucket

This is the `bucket` data stream. A bucket is a logical container for a related set of items such as key-value pairs or documents.

{{event "bucket"}}

{{fields "bucket"}}

### Cache

This is the `cache` data stream. The cache is hardware or software that is used to store something, usually data, temporarily in a computing environment. These metrics are related to caching in Couchbase.

{{event "cache"}}

{{fields "cache"}}

### Cluster

This is the `cluster` data stream. A cluster is a collection of nodes that are accessed and managed as a single group. Each node is an equal partner in orchestrating the cluster to provide facilities such as operational information (monitoring) or managing cluster membership of nodes and the health of nodes.

{{event "cluster"}}

{{fields "cluster"}}

### Couchbase Lite Replication

This is the `cbl_replication` data stream.

CBL Replication push is a process by which clients upload database changes from the local source database to the remote (server) target database.

CBL Replication pull is a process by which clients download database changes from the remote (server) source database to the local target database.

{{event "cbl_replication"}}

{{fields "cbl_replication"}}

### Database Stats

This is the `database_stats` data stream. Database statistics provides stats relative to the database like document writes, read and received.

{{event "database_stats"}}

{{fields "database_stats"}}

### Delta Sync, Import, Security and GSI views

This is the `miscellaneous` data stream.

The Delta Sync provides the ability to replicate only those parts of a Couchbase Mobile document that have changed. 

The import is processed with an admin user context in the Sync Function, similar to writes made through the Sync Gateway Admin API.

The Security metrics give the metrics related to authentication requests such as number of authentication failures and number of access errors.

Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) support queries made by the Query Service.

{{event "miscellaneous"}}

{{fields "miscellaneous"}}

### Resource Utilization

This is the `resource` data stream. The Resource Utilization metrics are related to [MemStats](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats) records statistics about the memory allocator.

{{event "resource"}}

{{fields "resource"}}

### Node

This is the `node` data stream. A Couchbase Server node is a physical or virtual machine that hosts a single instance of Couchbase Server.

{{event "node"}}

{{fields "node"}}

### Query Index

This is the `query_index` data stream. The Query service enables you to issue queries to extract data from the Couchbase server. The Index collects statistics provided by the Index service.

{{event "query_index"}}

{{fields "query_index"}}

### XDCR

This is the `xdcr` data stream. Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR) replicates data between a source bucket and a target bucket. XDCR collects metrics related to statistics of XDCR. Metrics can be fetched from multiple buckets.

Note: It is preferable to add a new integration if user requires to fetch metrics from multiple hosts for XDCR data stream.

{{event "xdcr"}}

{{fields "xdcr"}}
