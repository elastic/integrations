          If the S3 bucket will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldn't process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded. This is a list of selectors which are made up of regex and other options such as expand_event_list_from_field or parsers. If file_selectors is given, then any global expand_event_list_from_field or parsers values are ignored in favor of the ones specified in the file_selectors. Regexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed. For more information see [File Selectors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-aws-s3.html#_file_selectors)

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
