# Entro

## Overview

[Entro Security](https://entro.security/) allows you to discovers, monitors, and protects non-human identities (NHIs) and secrets. Entro Security also provides management of the lifecycle of these identities and secrets, from creation to rotation.

Use the Entro integration to monitor your exposed secrets and types. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference audit logs when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to see what types of secrets are being exposed more than usual you could look at the audit logs to isolate this information.
