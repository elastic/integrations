# Axonius Integration for Elastic

## Overview

[Axonius](https://www.axonius.com/) is a cybersecurity asset management platform that automatically collects data from hundreds of IT and security tools through adapters, merges that information, and builds a unified inventory of all assets—devices, users, SaaS apps, cloud instances, and more. By correlating data from multiple systems, Axonius helps organizations identify visibility gaps, missing security controls, risky configurations, and compliance issues. It lets you create powerful queries to answer any security or IT question and automate actions such as sending alerts, creating tickets, or enforcing policies.

This integration for Elastic allows you to collect assets and security events data using the Axonius API, then visualize the data in Kibana.

### Compatibility
The Axonius integration is compatible with product version **7.0**.

### How it works
This integration periodically queries the Axonius API to retrieve logs.

## What data does this integration collect?
This integration collects log messages of the following type:

- `User`: Collect details of all users (endpoint: `/api/v2/users`).

### Supported use cases

Integrating the Axonius User Datastream with Elastic SIEM provides centralized visibility into user identities and their associated context. Kibana dashboards uncover role distribution and key identity attributes, with core metrics helping analysts quickly assess user access posture across the environment.

Bar charts visualize Users by Role, enabling detection of unusual access concentrations or high-privileged user groups. The User Essential Details saved search provides a consolidated view of key identity attributes to support rapid triage and profile lookups during investigations. Tables such as Top Sources show the primary platforms contributing user data, helping analysts understand where identity information originates and identify gaps in coverage.

These insights allow security teams to monitor identity exposure, detect anomalies tied to privileged accounts, and streamline user-centric investigation workflows.

## What do I need to use this integration?

### From Elastic

This integration installs [Elastic latest transforms](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-overview#latest-transform-overview). For more details, check the [Transform](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-setup) setup and requirements.

### From Axonius

To collect data through the Axonius APIs, you need to provide the **URL**, **API Key** and **API Secret**. Authentication is handled using the **API Key** and **API Secret**, which serves as the required credential.

#### Retrieve URL, API Token and API Secret:

1. Log in to the **Axonius** instance.
2. Your instance URL is your Base **URL**.
3. Navigate to **User Settings > API Key**.
4. Generate an **API Key**.
5. Copy both values including **API Key and Secret Key** and store them securely for use in the Integration configuration.

## How do I deploy this integration?

This integration supports both Elastic Agentless-based and Agent-based installations.

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the syslog or log file receiver and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Agentless deployment

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. Agentless deployments provide a means to ingest data while avoiding the orchestration, management, and maintenance needs associated with standard ingest infrastructure. Using an agentless deployment makes manual agent deployment unnecessary, allowing you to focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it.

For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html)

### Configure

1. In the top search bar in Kibana, search for **Integrations**.
2. In the search bar, type **Axonius**.
3. Select the **Axonius** integration from the search results.
4. Select **Add Axonius** to add the integration.
5. Enable and configure only the collection methods which you will use.

    * To **Collect logs from Axonius API**, you'll need to:

        - Configure **URL**, **API Key** and **API Secret**.
        - Adjust the integration configuration parameters if required, including the Interval, HTTP Client Timeout etc. to enable data collection.

6. Select **Save and continue** to save the integration.

### Validation

#### Dashboard populated

1. In the top search bar in Kibana, search for **Dashboards**.
2. In the search bar, type **Axonius**, and verify the dashboard information is populated.
