# Trellix ePO Cloud

## Overview

The [Trellix ePO Cloud](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/products/epo.html) integration allows users to monitor devices, events and groups. Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator is centralized security management platform to orchestrate and manage all your endpoints.

Use the Trellix ePO integration to collect and parse data from ePO Cloud. This integration does not support on-premises installations of ePO. Then visualize that data from Trellix to identify threats through search, correlation and visualisation within Elastic Security.

## Data streams

The Trellix ePO Cloud integration collects three types of data: devices, events and groups.

**Devices** fetch all devices.

**Events** fetch all events.

**Groups** fetch all groups.
