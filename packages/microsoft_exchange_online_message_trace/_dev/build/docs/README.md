# Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace

This integration is for Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace logs. It includes the following
datasets for receiving logs over the Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace API or read from a file:

- `log` dataset: supports Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace logs.

## Logs

Logs are either gathered via the rest API or via a logfile.

### Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace API

The `log` dataset collects the Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace logs.

## Configuring with OAuth2
The basic auth fields have been deprecated from this integration since Microsoft has deprecated them and they no longer work.
Going forward OAuth2 needs to be configured for working with Microsoft Exchange Online Message Trace APIs.

### Steps :
You'll need to register your application with Azure Active Directory and obtain the necessary credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID. 
You can follow these steps to create an Azure AD application:

1) Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in.
2) Click on "Azure Active Directory" in the left-hand menu.
3) Select "App registrations" and click "New registration".
4) Enter a name for your application, select "Accounts in this organizational directory only" for "Supported account types", and enter the redirect 
   URI for your application.
5) Click "Register" to create the application.
6) On the application page, make note of the "Application (client) ID" (which is your client ID) and the "Directory (tenant) ID" (which is your 
   tenant ID).
7) Under "Certificates & secrets", click "New client secret" to create a new secret. Make note of the secret value (which is your client secret).

With these credentials in hand, you can now configure the integration with the appropriate parameters. 
### Logfile collection

The following sample Powershell script may be used to get the logs and put them into a JSON file that can then be
consumed by the logfile input:

Prerequisites:

````powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement
````

This script would have to be triggered at a certain interval, in accordance with the look back interval specified.
In this example script the look back would be 24 hours, so the interval would need to be daily.
According to the
[documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrace?view=exchange-ps)
it is only possible to get up to 1k pages.
If this should be an issue, try reducing the `$looback` or increasing `$pageSize`.

```powershell
# Username and Password
$username = "USERNAME@DOMAIN.TLD"
$password = "PASSWORD"
# Lookback in Hours
$lookback = "-24"
# Page Size, should be no problem with 1k
$pageSize = "1000"
# Output of the json file
# This would then be ingested via the integration
$output_location = "C:\temp\messageTrace.json"

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($username, $password)
$startDate = (Get-Date).AddHours($lookback)
$endDate = Get-Date

Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $Credential
$paginate = 1
$page = 1
$output = @()
while ($paginate -eq 1)
{
    $messageTrace = Get-MessageTrace -PageSize $pageSize -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -Page $page
    $page
    if (!$messageTrace)
    {
        $paginate = 0
    }
    else
    {
        $page++
        $output = $output + $messageTrace
    }
}
if (Test-Path $output_location)
{
    Remove-Item $output_location
}
foreach ($event in $output)
{
    $event.StartDate = [Xml.XmlConvert]::ToString(($event.StartDate), [Xml.XmlDateTimeSerializationMode]::Utc)
    $event.EndDate = [Xml.XmlConvert]::ToString(($event.EndDate), [Xml.XmlDateTimeSerializationMode]::Utc)
    $event.Received = [Xml.XmlConvert]::ToString(($event.Received), [Xml.XmlDateTimeSerializationMode]::Utc)
    $event = $event | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
    Add-Content $output_location $event -Encoding UTF8
}
```
