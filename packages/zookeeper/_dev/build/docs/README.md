# ZooKeeper Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from the [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) service.

## Compatibility

The ZooKeeper integration is tested with ZooKeeper 3.4.8 and is expected to work with all version >= 3.4.0. Versions prior to 3.4 do not support the mntr command.
