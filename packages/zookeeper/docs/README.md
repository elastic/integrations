# ZooKeeper Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from the [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) service.

## Compatibility

The ZooKeeper integration is tested with ZooKeeper 3.4.8 and is expected to work with all version >= 3.4.0. Versions prior to 3.4 do not support the mntr command.

## Metrics

### connection

The `connection` dataset fetches the data returned by the `cons` admin keyword.

An example event for `connection` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2020-07-06T16:12:07.612Z",
    "agent": {
        "ephemeral_id": "4d221f8f-7147-4855-8ea3-b4d2a5b80ae0",
