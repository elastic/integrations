# container-logs

container-logs integration collects and parses logs of Kubernetes containers.

It requires access to the log files in each Kubernetes node where the container logs are stored.
This defaults to `/var/log/containers/*${kubernetes.container.id}.log`.

By default only (container parser)[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-filestream.html#_parsers] is enabled. Additional log parsers can be added as an advanced options configuration.
