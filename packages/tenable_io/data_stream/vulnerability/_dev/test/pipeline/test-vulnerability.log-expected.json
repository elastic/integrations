(CVE-2016-1612)\n - A use-after-free error exists in `PDFium` due to improper invalidation of `IPWL_FocusHandler` and `IPWL_Provider` upon destruction.  An attacker can exploit this to dereference already freed memory, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1613)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists in `Blink` that is related to the handling of bitmaps.  An attacker can exploit this to access sensitive information.

An attacker can exploit this to have an unspecified impact.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1612)\n - A use-after-free error exists in `PDFium` due to improper invalidation of `IPWL_FocusHandler` and `IPWL_Provider` upon destruction.  An attacker can exploit this to dereference already freed memory, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1613)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists in `Blink` that is related to the handling of bitmaps.  An attacker can exploit this to access sensitive information.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1614)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists in `omnibox` that is related to origin confusion.  An attacker can exploit this to have an unspecified impact.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1615)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists that allows an attacker to spoof a displayed URL.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1616)\n - An unspecified vulnerability exists that is related to history sniffing with HSTS and CSP. No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1617)\n - A flaw exists in `Blink` due to the weak generation of random numbers by the ARC4-based random number generator.  An attacker can exploit this to gain access to sensitive information.  No other details are available. (CVE-2016-1618)\n - An out-of-bounds read error exists in `PDFium` in file `fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp` in the `sycc4{22,44}_to_rgb()` functions. An attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service by crashing the application linked using the library. (CVE-2016-1619)\n - Multiple vulnerabilities exist, the most serious of which allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page. (CVE-2016-1620)\n - A flaw in `objects.cc` is triggered when handling cleared `WeakCells`, which may allow a context-dependent attacker to have an unspecified impact. No further details have been provided. (CVE-2016-2051)",
