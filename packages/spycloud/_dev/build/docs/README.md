# SpyCloud Enterprise Protection

## Ingest SpyCloud Cybercrime Analytics into Elastic Agent

[SpyCloud’s Enterprise Protection](https://spycloud.com/) integration leverages recaptured darknet data to safeguard employees' digital identities by producing actionable insights to proactively prevent account takeover and follow-on targeted attacks before they happen.

The Elastic Agent uses the SpyCloud Enterprise Protection REST API to collect data.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against the latest SpyCloud Enterprise Protection API **V2**.

## Data streams

The SpyCloud integration collects three types of logs: Breach Catalog, Breach Record and Compass Malware Records.

- **[Breach Catalog](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/catalog-list)** - a collection of third-party breach and malware data ingested into SpyCloud. The catalog contains thousands of breach objects, each of which contain metadata for a particular breach. A typical breach object contains a variety of metadata including a breach title, description, acquisition date, link to affected websites and many more data points.

- **[Breach Record](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/data-watchlist)** - a collection of data assets extracted from third-party breach and malware data. These assets are grouped together to form a data record which represents a single user account or individual persona in parsed data.

- **[Compass Malware Records](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/compass-data-get)** - a collection of data assets extracted from malware data that provides full visibility into infection events to enable post-infection remediation on compromised devices, users, and applications.

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details and installation instructions, please refer to the [Elastic Agent Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

There are several options for installing and managing Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where it’s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

Please note, there are minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent. For more information, refer to the  [Elastic Agent Minimum Requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html#elastic-agent-installation-minimum-requirements).

## Setup

### To collect logs through REST API, follow the below steps:

- Considering you already have a SpyCloud account, log in to your SpyCloud instance to obtain your API key. Navigate to **Main > API**, where you will find your API key under the **Keys > API Key** section.
- To obtain the Base URL, navigate to **Main > API** and click on the **View Docs** link, your URL can be located within the **API Reference** section.

**NOTE**: Your system's IP should be allowlisted by the SpyCloud team to be able to access the APIs and get the data.

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana navigate to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" top bar, search for `SpyCloud Enterprise Protection`.
3. Select the "SpyCloud Enterprise Protection" integration from the search results.
4. Select "Add SpyCloud Enterprise Protection Integration" to add the integration.
5. While adding the integration, if you want to collect Breach Catalog logs via REST API, please enter the following details:
