# SpyCloud Enterprise Protection

## Ingest SpyCloud Cybercrime Analytics into Elastic Agent

[SpyCloudâ€™s Enterprise Protection](https://spycloud.com/) integration leverages recaptured darknet data to safeguard employees' digital identities by producing actionable insights to proactively prevent account takeover and follow-on targeted attacks before they happen.

The Elastic Agent uses the SpyCloud Enterprise Protection REST API to collect data.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against the latest SpyCloud Enterprise Protection API **V2**.

## Data streams

The SpyCloud integration collects three types of logs: Breach Catalog, Breach Record and Compass Malware Records.

- **[Breach Catalog](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/catalog-list)** - a collection of third-party breach and malware data ingested into SpyCloud. The catalog contains thousands of breach objects, each of which contain metadata for a particular breach. A typical breach object contains a variety of metadata including a breach title, description, acquisition date, link to affected websites and many more data points.

- **[Breach Record](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/data-watchlist)** - a collection of data assets extracted from third-party breach and malware data. These assets are grouped together to form a data record which represents a single user account or individual persona in parsed data.

- **[Compass Malware Records](https://spycloud-external.readme.io/sc-enterprise-api/reference/compass-data-get)** - a collection of data assets extracted from malware data that provides full visibility into infection events to enable post-infection remediation on compromised devices, users, and applications.

## Requirements

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
