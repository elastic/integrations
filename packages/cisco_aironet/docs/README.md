# Cisco Aironet Integration for Elastic

> **Note**: This documentation was generated using AI and should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Overview

The Cisco Aironet integration for Elastic enables you to collect and analyze logs from Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC). This allows you to centralize the monitoring of wireless network activities, providing deep visibility into the health and security of your wireless infrastructure. By ingesting system messages, you can track client events, hardware status, and security alerts within the Elastic Stack.

This integration facilitates:
- Wireless security auditing: Monitor client authentication attempts, association/disassociation events, and rogue access point detections to identify potential security threats or unauthorized access attempts.
- Operational troubleshooting: Track system-level events, hardware status changes, and radio frequency (RF) interference alerts to quickly diagnose and resolve connectivity issues for mobile users.
- Compliance and reporting: Maintain a long-term audit trail of administrative configuration changes and system access logs to meet regulatory requirements and internal governance policies.
- Performance monitoring: Analyze logs related to access point (AP) join/leave events and controller load to optimize wireless coverage and capacity planning across a campus or enterprise environment.

### Compatibility

This integration is compatible with the following third-party vendor versions:
- Cisco Aironet Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) running AireOS firmware.
- Supported hardware including the Cisco 2504, 3504, 5508, 5520, and 8540 series controllers.

This integration is compatible with Elastic Stack version 8.11.0 or later.

### How it works

This integration collects logs from Cisco Aironet devices by receiving syslog data over the network or by reading directly from log files. You can deploy an Elastic Agent on a host and configure it as a syslog receiver using the `udp` or `tcp` input, or point it to a specific log file using the `logfile` input. Once configured, the agent forwards the system messages, authentication events, and network status updates to your Elastic deployment, where they are mapped to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) for analysis.

## What data does this integration collect?

The Cisco Aironet integration collects log messages of the following types:
* System messages: These include process status, hardware alerts, and system-level events generated by the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software.
* Network events: These logs relate to wireless protocol transitions, interface status changes, and DHCP or Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) events.
* Security logs: These records cover authentication events for RADIUS and TACACS+, unauthorized access attempts, and configuration audit trails.

The integration provides the `log` data stream to capture these events. Depending on how you configure the input, it collects data in the following ways:
* UDP or TCP input: Collects Cisco Aironet logs sent over the network.
* Logfile input: Collects logs from a file when they're written to a local disk or a shared mount point.

All collected logs are mapped to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), supporting standard Cisco system message formats received via Syslog (RFC 3164/5424) or read directly from local log files.

### Supported use cases

Integrating Cisco Aironet logs with Elastic provides visibility into your wireless network infrastructure. You can use this integration for the following:
* Security monitoring: You'll be able to track authentication successes and failures to identify potential unauthorized access attempts or credential issues.
* Network troubleshooting: You can monitor interface status changes and protocol transitions to diagnose connectivity problems or hardware alerts.
* Audit and compliance: You can maintain a searchable history of configuration changes and system events to meet regulatory requirements and internal audit needs.
* Operational visibility: You'll gain insights into the health of your WLC software and hardware components through system-level event tracking.

## What do I need to use this integration?

To use this integration, you need the following from your Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) environment:
- High-level administrative credentials (GUI) or Enable-level access (CLI) on the Cisco WLC.
- Network connectivity that permits traffic from the WLC IP addresses to the Elastic Agent host on the configured port (default is `9009`) via TCP or UDP.
- Software licenses on the WLC that support remote syslog forwarding.
- NTP configured on the Cisco WLC to ensure timestamps in logs are accurate and align with your Elastic Stack environment.

You also need the following Elastic Stack components:
- Elastic Stack version 8.11.0 or later for full compatibility.
- An Elastic Agent installed on a host reachable by the Cisco WLC and successfully enrolled in Fleet.
- An Elastic Agent policy that includes the Cisco Aironet integration.
- The target port (e.g., `9009`) open on the host running the Elastic Agent and not currently bound by another service.

## How do I deploy this integration?

### Agent-based deployment

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the syslog or log file receiver and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Set up steps in Cisco Aironet

You can configure your Cisco Aironet Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to send logs to the Elastic Agent host using either the web interface or the command line.

#### For AireOS (Traditional WLC) via Web GUI

Follow these steps to configure syslog using the Cisco WLC web administration interface:

1.  Log in to the Cisco WLC web administration interface.
2.  Navigate to **Management > Logs > Config**.
3.  In the **Syslog Servers** section, locate the next available slot (up to 3 servers can be configured).
4.  Enter the **Syslog Server IP Address**. This is the IP address of the host where the Elastic Agent is installed.
5.  Click **Add**.
6.  Configure the **Syslog Level** (Severity) from the drop-down menu. It's recommended to select `Informational` (Level 6) for production monitoring.
7.  Configure the **Syslog Facility** from the drop-down menu. The default is `Syslog` (Facility level 5).
8.  Click **Apply** in the top right corner to save the active configuration.
9.  To ensure the settings persist after a reboot, click **Save Configuration** at the top of the page.

#### For AireOS (Traditional WLC) via CLI

Follow these steps to configure syslog using the command line interface:

1.  Connect to the WLC via SSH or Console.
2.  Enter the command to add the Elastic Agent as a syslog host (up to 3 servers can be configured):
`config logging syslog host <Elastic_Agent_IP>` (replace with your actual value)

3.  Set the desired severity level (only messages with severity equal to or less than this level will be sent):
`config logging syslog level <severity_level>`

4.  (Optional) Configure the syslog facility if required for filtering:
`config logging syslog facility <facility_code>`

5.  (Optional) Enable debug logging to syslog if necessary for deep troubleshooting:
`config logging debug syslog enable`

6.  Save the configuration to ensure settings persist after a reboot:
`save config`

After configuring the inputs, click **Save and continue** to deploy the configuration to the Elastic Agent.

### Validation

To verify that the integration is working properly and data is flowing into Elasticsearch, follow these steps.

First, trigger data flow on the Cisco Aironet device by performing one of the following actions:
- Authentication event: Attempt to log into the WLC web interface or CLI with an incorrect password, then log in successfully to generate authentication logs.
- Configuration event: Enter configuration mode in the CLI (`config t`) and then exit (`exit`) to trigger a configuration audit event.
- Interface/AP event: Power cycle an Access Point or toggle a test interface status using the `shutdown` and `no shutdown` commands to trigger join or disassociation messages.

Next, check for data in Kibana:
1.  Navigate to **Analytics > Discover**.
2.  Select the `logs-*` data view.
3.  Enter the KQL filter: `data_stream.dataset : "cisco_aironet.log"`
4.  Verify that logs appear in the results. Expand a log entry and confirm these fields are populated:
    - `event.dataset` (should be `cisco_aironet.log`)
    - `event.action` or `log.syslog.priority`
    - `message` (the raw log payload)
5.  Navigate to **Analytics > Dashboards** and search for "Cisco Aironet" to view pre-built visualizations.

## Troubleshooting

For help with Elastic ingest tools, check [Common problems](https://www.elastic.co/docs/troubleshoot/ingest/fleet/common-problems).

### Common configuration issues

The following are common issues you might encounter when configuring the Cisco Aironet integration:

- **Port mismatch**: Cisco WLCs are frequently hardcoded to send syslog over `UDP` port `514`. If the integration is left at the default `9009`, no data is received. Ensure the integration's listen port matches the port the WLC is actually using.
- **Firewall blocking**: Local host firewalls like `iptables` or `firewalld`, or network firewalls, may block `UDP` traffic on port `514` or `9009`. Verify connectivity using `tcpdump` or `nc -u -l 514` on the agent host.
- **WLC syslog level**: If no logs appear, check that the WLC syslog level is not set too high (for example, to `Critical` only). Set it to `Informational` to ensure enough data is generated for verification.
- **AP global configuration**: If WLC logs arrive but Access Point logs do not, ensure the AP remote syslog host IP is specifically set in the Wireless > Global Configuration section.
- **Ingestion parsing failures**: If logs are ingested but contain the `_grokparsefailure` tag, the syslog format from the WLC may be non-standard. Check the `event.original` field to see if the message matches the expected Cisco format.
- **Syslog format mismatches**: Cisco WLCs can sometimes include or exclude sequence numbers or timestamps. Ensure the WLC is configured to send standard system messages without excessive custom formatting.
- **High volume packet loss**: When using `UDP`, you might experience packet loss during traffic bursts. Ensure the `read_buffer` in `udp_options` is appropriately sized (the default is `100MiB`).
- **High CPU load**: Forwarding `Debugging` (level 7) logs in production can overwhelm the ingest pipeline and increase CPU load on both the source system and the Elastic Agent. Use `Informational` (level 6) or `Warnings` (level 4) instead.

## Performance and scaling

For more information on architectures that can be used for scaling this integration, check the [Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/ingest-reference-architectures) documentation.

To ensure optimal performance in high-volume environments, you should consider the following settings and configurations:

*   Transport and collection considerations: While UDP is faster for syslog transmission, use TCP for environments where delivery guarantees are required. When you use UDP, ensure the `read_buffer` in `udp_options` is appropriately sized (default `100MiB`) to prevent packet loss during traffic bursts. For TCP, configure `max_connections` to handle concurrent streams from multiple controllers.
*   Data volume management: Configure the Cisco WLC to forward only necessary events by adjusting the syslog level. It's recommended to use `Informational` (level 6) or `Warnings` (level 4). Avoid forwarding `Debugging` (level 7) logs in production as they can overwhelm the ingest pipeline and increase CPU load on both the source system and the Elastic Agent.
*   Elastic Agent scaling: For high-throughput environments with thousands of Access Points, deploy multiple Elastic Agents behind a network load balancer to distribute traffic evenly. Place Agents close to the data source to minimize latency and potential packet loss over the network.

| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset |  | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| observer.ingress.interface.id | Interface ID as reported by an observer (typically SNMP interface ID). | keyword |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.name.text | Multi-field of `process.name`. | match_only_text |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.mac | MAC address of the source. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.description | Describes the type of action conducted by the threat. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.type | Type of indicator as represented by Cyber Observable in STIX 2.0. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |
