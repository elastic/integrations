        title: Interval
        description: >-
          Interval to fetch data from Proofpoint TAP API. The Proofpoint API applies a rolling 24 hour request limit to users of the API. The clicks blocked, messages delivered and messages blocked endpoints allow a pooled 1800 requests over a 24 hour period. After that requests will be throttled. See details [here](https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/API_Documentation/SIEM_API#Throttle_Limits). To avoid throttling, assuming all data streams are being ingested, the interval should be at least 2m30s. NOTE: Supported units for this parameter are h/m/s.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
