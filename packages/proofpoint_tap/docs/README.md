| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |

| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| destination.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| destination.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| destination.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| email.from.address | The email address of the sender, typically from the RFC 5322 `From:` header field. | keyword |
| email.message_id | Identifier from the RFC 5322 `Message-ID:` email header that refers to a particular email message. | wildcard |
| email.to.address | The email address of recipient | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host ID. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host IP addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.campaign_id | An identifier for the campaign of which the threat is a member, if available at the time of the query. Threats can be linked to campaigns even after these events are retrieved. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.classification | The threat category of the malicious URL. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.sender_ip | The IP address of the sender. | ip |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.threat.id | The unique identifier associated with this threat. It can be used to query the forensics and campaign endpoints. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.threat.status | The current state of the threat. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.threat.time | Proofpoint identified the URL as a threat at this time. | date |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_blocked.threat.url | A link to the entry on the TAP Dashboard for the particular threat. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.guid | The ID of the message within PPS. It can be used to identify the message in PPS and is guaranteed to be unique. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.fragment | Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top". The `#` is not part of the fragment. | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.full.text | Multi-field of `url.full`. | match_only_text |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.password | Password of the request. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.username | Username of the request. | keyword |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.original.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.original`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.full`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| user_agent.version | Version of the user agent. | keyword |

| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| destination.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| destination.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `destination.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| destination.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| email.from.address | The email address of the sender, typically from the RFC 5322 `From:` header field. | keyword |
| email.message_id | Identifier from the RFC 5322 `Message-ID:` email header that refers to a particular email message. | wildcard |
| email.to.address | The email address of recipient | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host ID. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host IP addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.campaign_id | An identifier for the campaign of which the threat is a member, if available at the time of the query. Threats can be linked to campaigns even after these events are retrieved. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.classification | The threat category of the malicious URL. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.sender_ip | The IP address of the sender. | ip |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.threat.id | The unique identifier associated with this threat. It can be used to query the forensics and campaign endpoints. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.threat.status | The current state of the threat. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.threat.time | Proofpoint identified the URL as a threat at this time. | date |
| proofpoint_tap.clicks_permitted.threat.url | A link to the entry on the TAP Dashboard for the particular threat. | keyword |
| proofpoint_tap.guid | The ID of the message within PPS. It can be used to identify the message in PPS and is guaranteed to be unique. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.fragment | Portion of the url after the `#`, such as "top". The `#` is not part of the fragment. | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.full.text | Multi-field of `url.full`. | match_only_text |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.password | Password of the request. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.username | Username of the request. | keyword |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.original.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.original`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.full`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| user_agent.version | Version of the user agent. | keyword |

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization ID used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account ID, Google Cloud ORG ID, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container ID. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| email.attachments | A list of objects describing the attachment files sent along with an email message. | nested |
| email.attachments.file.hash.md5 | MD5 hash. | keyword |
| email.attachments.file.hash.sha256 | SHA256 hash. | keyword |
| email.attachments.file.name | Name of the attachment file including the file extension. | keyword |
| email.cc.address | The email address of CC recipient | keyword |
| email.content_type | Information about how the message is to be displayed. Typically a MIME type. | keyword |
| email.delivery_timestamp | The date and time when the email message was received by the service or client. | date |
| email.from.address | The email address of the sender, typically from the RFC 5322 `From:` header field. | keyword |
| email.message_id | Identifier from the RFC 5322 `Message-ID:` email header that refers to a particular email message. | wildcard |
| email.reply_to.address | The address that replies should be delivered to based on the value in the RFC 5322 `Reply-To:` header. | keyword |
| email.sender.address | Per RFC 5322, specifies the address responsible for the actual transmission of the message. | keyword |
| email.subject | A brief summary of the topic of the message. | keyword |
| email.subject.text | Multi-field of `email.subject`. | match_only_text |
| email.to.address | The email address of recipient | keyword |
| email.x_mailer | The name of the application that was used to draft and send the original email message. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host ID. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host IP addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| proofpoint_tap.guid | The ID of the message within PPS. It can be used to identify the message in PPS and is guaranteed to be unique. | keyword |

| proofpoint_tap.message_blocked.message_parts.sandbox_status | The verdict returned by the sandbox during the scanning process. If the value is "unsupported", the messagePart is not supported by Attachment Defense and was not scanned. If the value is "clean", the sandbox returned a clean verdict. If the value is "threat", the sandbox returned a malicious verdict. If the value is "prefilter", the messagePart contained no active content, and was therefore not sent to the sandboxing service. If the value is "uploaded," the message was uploaded by PPS to the sandboxing service, but did not yet have a verdict at the time the message was processed. If the value is "inprogress," the attachment had been uploaded and was awaiting scanning at the time the message was processed.

| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.created | event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline. This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event. In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source. In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used. | date |
| event.dataset | Event dataset. | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module. | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
