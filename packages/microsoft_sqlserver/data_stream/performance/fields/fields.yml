          description: Number of temporary tables/table variables in use.
        - name: transactions
          type: long
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of transactions
        - name: connection_reset_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logins started per second from the connection pool.
        - name: logins_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections.
        - name: logouts_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logout operations started per second.
        - name: re_compilations_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of statement recompiles per second. Counts the number of times statement recompiles are triggered. Generally, you want the recompiles to be low.
        - name: compilations_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of SQL compilations per second. Indicates the number of times the compile code path is entered. Includes compiles caused by statement-level recompilations in SQL Server. After SQL Server user activity is stable, this value reaches a steady state.
        - name: batch_requests_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput.
        - name: buffer_cache_hit_ratio
          type: double
          metric_type: gauge
          description: The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After a long period of time, the ratio moves very little. Because reading from the cache is much less expensive than reading from disk, you want this ratio to be high.
        - name: buffer_page_life_expectancy
          type: long
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Indicates the number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references (in seconds).
        - name: buffer_checkpoint_pages_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Indicates the number of pages flushed to disk per second by a checkpoint or other operation that require all dirty pages to be flushed.
        - name: buffer_database_pages
          type: long
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Indicates the number of pages in the buffer pool with database content.
        - name: buffer_target_pages
          type: long
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Ideal number of pages in the buffer pool.
        - name: memory_grants_pending
          type: long
          description: This is generated from the default pattern given for Dynamic Counter Name variable. This counter tells us how many processes are waiting for the memory to be assigned to them so they can get started.
