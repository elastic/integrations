          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of page splits per second that occur as the result of overflowing index pages.

          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of lock requests per second that required the caller to wait.

          type: long
          description: Total number of user connections.
        - name: active_temp_tables
          type: long
          description: Number of temporary tables/table variables in use.
        - name: transactions
          type: long
          description: Total number of transactions
        - name: connection_reset_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logins started per second from the connection pool.
        - name: logins_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections.
        - name: logouts_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Total number of logout operations started per second.
        - name: re_compilations_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of statement recompiles per second. Counts the number of times statement recompiles are triggered. Generally, you want the recompiles to be low.
        - name: compilations_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of SQL compilations per second. Indicates the number of times the compile code path is entered. Includes compiles caused by statement-level recompilations in SQL Server. After SQL Server user activity is stable, this value reaches a steady state.
        - name: batch_requests_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput.
        - name: buffer_cache_hit_ratio
          type: double
          description: The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After a long period of time, the ratio moves very little. Because reading from the cache is much less expensive than reading from disk, you want this ratio to be high.
        - name: buffer_page_life_expectancy
          type: long
          description: Indicates the number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references (in seconds).
        - name: buffer_checkpoint_pages_per_sec
          type: float
          metric_type: gauge
          description: Indicates the number of pages flushed to disk per second by a checkpoint or other operation that require all dirty pages to be flushed.
        - name: buffer_database_pages
          type: long
          description: Indicates the number of pages in the buffer pool with database content.
        - name: buffer_target_pages
          type: long
          description: Ideal number of pages in the buffer pool.
        - name: dynamic_counter.value
          type: long
          description: Dynamic counter value is fetched from performance table for the dynamic counter name which is provided by user.
        - name: dynamic_counter.name
          type: keyword
          description: Dynamic counter name is given by user.
