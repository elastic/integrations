# Microsoft SQL Server Integration

The Microsoft SQL Server integration package allows you to search, observe, and visualize the SQL Server audit logs, as well as performance and transaction log metrics, through Elasticsearch.

## Data streams

The Microsoft SQL Server integration collects two types of data streams: logs and metrics.

**Log** data streams provide records of events happening in Microsoft SQL Server:

* `audit`: Events from the configured Windows event log channel, providing detailed auditing information. See [SQL Server Audit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15).
* `logs`: Error logs created by the Microsoft SQL server for troubleshooting and system events.

Other log sources, such as files, are not supported.

Find more details in [Logs](#logs).

**Metrics** data streams provide insights into SQL Server performance and health:

* `performance`: Comprehensive performance counters and objects available on the server.
* `transaction_log`: Usage statistics and space utilization metrics for transaction logs.

Find more details in [Metrics](#metrics).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your hardware.

### Microsoft SQL Server permissions

Before you can start sending data to Elastic, make sure you have the necessary Microsoft SQL Server permissions.

If you browse Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) for the following tables, you will find a "Permissions" section that defines the permission needed for each table (for example, [the "Permissions" section on the `sys.dm_db_log_space_usage`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-space-usage-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#permissions) page).

1. `transaction_log`:
    - [sys.databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysdatabases-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)
    - [sys.dm_db_log_space_usage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-space-usage-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)
    - [sys.dm_db_log_stats (DB_ID)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-stats-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) (Available on SQL Server (MSSQL) 2016 (13.x) SP 2 and later)
2. `performance`:
    - [sys.dm_os_performance_counters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)

Please make sure the user has the permissions to system as well as user-defined databases. For the particular user used in the integration, the following requirements are met:

User setup options:

- Grant specific permissions as mentioned in the MSDN pages above.
- Alteratively, use `sysadmin` role (includes all required permissions): This can be configured via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) in `Server Roles`. Read more about joining a role in the [SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/join-a-role?view=sql-server-ver16#SSMSProcedure).

User Mappings (using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)):

- Open SSMS and connect to your server.
- Navigate to "Object Explorer" > "Security" > "Logins".
- Right-click the user and select "Properties".
- In the "User Mapping" tab, select the appropriate database and grant the required permissions.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up any integration, refer to the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

Below you'll find more specific details on setting up the Microsoft SQL Server integration.

### Named Instance

Microsoft SQL Server has a feature that allows running multiple databases on the same host (or clustered hosts) with separate settings. Establish a named instance connection by using the instance name along with the hostname (e.g. `host/instance_name` or `host:named_instance_port`) to collect metrics. Details of the host configuration are provided below.

#### Query by Instance Name or Server Name in Kibana

The data can be visualized in Kibana by filtering based on the instance name and server name. The instance name can be filtered by `mssql.metrics.instance_name` and the server name by `mssql.metrics.server_name` fields.

### Host Configuration

As part of the input configuration, you need to provide the user name, password and host details. The host configuration supports both named instances or default (no-name) instances, using the syntax below.

>Note: This integration supports collecting metrics from a single host. For multi-host metrics, each host can be run as a new integration.

**Connecting to Default Instance (host)**:

* `host`        (e.g. `localhost` (Instance name is not needed when connecting to default instance))
* `host:port`   (e.g. `localhost:1433`)

**Connecting to Named Instance (host)**:

* `host/instance_name`          (e.g. `localhost/namedinstance_01`)
* `host:named_instance_port`    (e.g. `localhost:60873`)



### Configuration

#### Audit

There are several levels of auditing for SQL Server, depending on government or standards requirements for your installation. The SQL Server Audit feature enables you to audit server-level and database-level groups of events and individual events.

For more information on the different audit levels, refer to [SQL Server Audit Action Groups and Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-action-groups-and-actions?view=sql-server-ver15).
Then to enable auditing for SQL Server, refer to these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/create-a-server-audit-and-server-audit-specification?view=sql-server-ver15).

>Note: For the integration package to be able to read and send audit events the event target must be configured to be Windows event log.

#### Audit events

Collects SQL Server audit events from the specified windows event log channel.

#### Log

The SQL Server `log` contains user-defined events and certain system events you can use for troubleshooting.

Read more in [View the SQL Server error log in SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/view-the-sql-server-error-log-sql-server-management-studio?view=sql-server-ver16).

#### Performance metrics

Collects the `performance` counter metrics. The dynamic counter feature provides flexibility to collect metrics by providing the counter as an input.
This input can be a regular expression which will filter results based on pattern.
For example, if %grant% is given as input, it will enable metrics collection for all of the counters with names like 'Memory Grants Pending', 'Active memory grants count' etc.
MSSQL supports a limited set of regular expressions. For more details, refer to [Pattern Matching in Search Conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms187489(v=sql.105)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

> Note: Dynamic counters will go through some basic ingest pipeline post-processing to make counter names in lowercase and remove special characters and these fields will not have any static field mappings.

The feature `merge_results` has been introduced in 8.4 beats which creates a single event by combining the metrics in a single event. For more details, refer to [SQL module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-sql.html#_example_merge_multiple_queries_into_a_single_event).

Read more in [instructions about each performance counter metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15).

#### Transaction log metrics

The system-level database `transaction_log` metrics for SQL Server instances are collected by default. Metrics for user-level databases can be collected by specifying a list of user databases or by enabling the `Fetch from all databases` toggle to collect metrics from all databases on the server.

Read more in [instructions and the operations supported by transaction log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/logs/the-transaction-log-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15).

#### Fetch from all databases

To simplify the process of fetching metrics from all databases on the server, you can enable the `Fetch from all databases` toggle when configuring the integration. This field overrides manually entered database names in the `Databases` input and instead fetches the required `transaction_log` metrics from all databases, including system and user-defined databases.

Keep in mind that this feature is disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled to be activated.

#### Password URL encoding

When the password contains special characters, pass these special characters using URL encoding.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | keyword |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |
| mssql.metrics.active_temp_tables | Number of temporary tables/table variables in use. | long | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.batch_requests_per_sec | Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.buffer_cache_hit_ratio | The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After a long period of time, the ratio moves very little. Because reading from the cache is much less expensive than reading from disk, you want this ratio to be high. | double | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.buffer_checkpoint_pages_per_sec | Indicates the number of pages flushed to disk per second by a checkpoint or other operation that require all dirty pages to be flushed. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.buffer_database_pages | Indicates the number of pages in the buffer pool with database content. | long | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.buffer_page_life_expectancy | Indicates the number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references (in seconds). | long | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.buffer_target_pages | Ideal number of pages in the buffer pool. | long | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.compilations_per_sec | Number of SQL compilations per second. Indicates the number of times the compile code path is entered. Includes compiles caused by statement-level recompilations in SQL Server. After SQL Server user activity is stable, this value reaches a steady state. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.connection_reset_per_sec | Total number of logins started per second from the connection pool. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.instance_name | Name of the mssql connected instance. | keyword |  |
| mssql.metrics.lock_waits_per_sec | Number of lock requests per second that required the caller to wait. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.logins_per_sec | Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.logouts_per_sec | Total number of logout operations started per second. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.memory_grants_pending | This is generated from the default pattern given for Dynamic Counter Name variable. This counter tells us how many processes are waiting for the memory to be assigned to them so they can get started. | long |  |
| mssql.metrics.page_splits_per_sec | Number of page splits per second that occur as the result of overflowing index pages. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.re_compilations_per_sec | Number of statement recompiles per second. Counts the number of times statement recompiles are triggered. Generally, you want the recompiles to be low. | float | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.server_name | Name of the mssql server. | keyword |  |
| mssql.metrics.transactions | Total number of transactions | long | gauge |
| mssql.metrics.user_connections | Total number of user connections. | long | gauge |
| service.address | Address where data about this service was collected from. This should be a URI, network address (ipv4:port or [ipv6]:port) or a resource path (sockets). | keyword |  |


### transaction_log

The Microsoft SQL Server `transaction_log` dataset provides metrics from the log space usage and log stats tables. All `transaction_log` metrics will be available in the `sqlserver.metrics` field group.

An example event for `transaction_log` looks as following:
