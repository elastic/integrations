# blacklens.io

The [blacklens.io](https://blacklens.io) integration allows you to monitor alerts. blacklens.io is a comprehensive Attack Surface Management platform that helps businesses understand and secure their external attack surface. By combining automated security analysis, continuous monitoring, and penetration testing, it identifies and addresses vulnerabilities early. With features like Darknet Monitoring, Vulnerability Scanning, and XDR Response, blacklens.io provides a proactive defense strategy to protect companies from cyber threats while offering a clear view of their security posture at all times.

Use the blacklens.io integration to fetch all related alerts about your Attack Surface. Then visualize that data in Kibana and create further alerts or enrich the data with other security solutions.

## Elastic Managed enabled integration

Elastic Managed integrations are only supported on Elastic Cloud Serverless and Elastic Cloud Hosted deployments. An Elastic Managed integration lets you ingest data from a cloud source while avoiding the orchestration, management, and maintenance associated with standard ingest infrastructure. Elastic runs the collector for you, so you can focus on your data instead of the infrastructure that collects it.

For more information, refer to [Elastic Managed integrations](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations) and the [Elastic Managed integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations-faq).

## Data streams

The blacklens.io integration collects one type of data streams: logs

**Alerts** returns a list of blacklens.io alerts (The API Docs are referenced within the portal)
## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.
You will require the `alerts:read` permission in order to fetch the Alerts via the API.

You need an active blacklens.io subscription and a user with the `alerts:read` permission to retrieve alerts via the API.
