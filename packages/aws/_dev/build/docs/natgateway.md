# AWS NAT gateway

The AWS NAT gateway integration allows you to monitor [NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) on Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.

Use the AWS NAT gateway integration to collect metrics related to your NAT gateways. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to view the total number of concurrent, active TCP connections through the NAT gateway.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS NAT gateway integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of your NAT gateways.
Metrics collected by this integration include the number of connection attempts made through the NAT gateway, the total number of concurrent, active TCP connections through the NAT gateway, the number of times the NAT gateway could not allocate a source port, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect AWS NAT gateway metrics.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
