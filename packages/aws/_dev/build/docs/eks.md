# Amazon EKS

The Amazon EC2 integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), a managed kubernetes service.

Amazon EKS integration offers users a way to stream EKS logs from CloudWatch or Kinesis Data Firehose to Elastic Cloud.
This integration includes predefined rules that automatically route EKS logs to the respective integrations, which
include field mappings, ingest pipelines, and predefined dashboards.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The Amazon EC2 integration collects logs.

**eks_logs** includes predefined rules that automatically route EKS logs to the respective integrations, which
include field mappings, ingest pipelines, and predefined dashboards.

Here is a list of log types that are supported by this integration:

| EKS log type       | Log destination               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Audit              | kubernetes.audit_logs         |
| API Server         | kubernetes.apiserver          |
| Authenticator      | aws.eks_authenticator_logs    |
| Controller Manager | kubernetes.controllermanager  |
| Scheduler          | kubernetes.scheduler          |

**eks_authenticator_logs** contains EKS Authenticator logs
Authenticator logs are unique to Amazon EKS. These logs represent the control plane component that Amazon EKS uses for Kubernetes Role Based Access Control.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon EC2 service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
{{ url "getting-started-observability" "Getting started" }} guide.

### Advanced options

#### CloudWatch

The CloudWatch logs input has several advanced options to fit specific use cases.

##### Latency

AWS CloudWatch Logs sometimes takes extra time to make the latest logs available to clients like the Agent.

The CloudWatch integration offers the `latency` setting to address this scenario. Latency translates the query's time range to consider the CloudWatch Logs latency. For example, a `5m` latency means the integration will query CloudWatch for logs available 5 minutes ago.

##### Number of workers

If you are collecting log events from multiple log groups using `log_group_name_prefix`, you should review the value of the `number_of_workers`.

The `number_of_workers` setting defines the number of workers assigned to reading from log groups. Each log group matching the `log_group_name_prefix` requires a worker to keep log ingestion as close to real-time as possible. For example, if `log_group_name_prefix` matches five log groups, then `number_of_workers` should be set to `5`. The default value is `1`.

## Logs reference

The `eks_logs` data stream supports both EC2 logs stored in AWS CloudWatch and EC2 logs stored in Amazon S3.
For logs stored in S3, you must export logs from log groups to an Amazon S3 bucket which has SQS notification setup already.

With this data stream, EC2 logs will be parsed into fields like  `ip_address`
and `process.name`. For logs from other services, please use the **AWS CloudWatch** integration.
