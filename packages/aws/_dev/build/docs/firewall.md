# AWS Network Firewall

This integration is used to fetch logs and metrics from [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)â€”a network protections service for Amazon VPCs.

Use the AWS Network Firewall integration to monitor the traffic entering and passing through your AWS Network Firewall. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference logs and metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to view and track when firewall rules are triggered, the top firewall source and destination countries, and the total number of events by firewall.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS Network Firewall integration collects two types of data: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in AWS Network Firewall.
Logs collected by the AWS Network Firewall integration include the observer name, source and destination IP, port, country, event type, and more. See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of Network Firewall.
Metrics collected by the AWS Network Firewall integration include the number of packets received, passed, and blocked by the AWS Network Firewall, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS Network Firewall service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

### Advanced options

#### CloudWatch

The CloudWatch logs input has several advanced options to fit specific use cases.

##### Latency

AWS CloudWatch Logs sometimes takes extra time to make the latest logs available to clients like the Agent.

The CloudWatch integration offers the `latency` setting to address this scenario. Latency translates the query's time range to consider the CloudWatch Logs latency. For example, a `5m` latency means the integration will query CloudWatch for logs available 5 minutes ago.

##### Number of workers

If you are collecting log events from multiple log groups using `log_group_name_prefix`, you should review the value of the `number_of_workers`.

The `number_of_workers` setting defines the number of workers assigned to reading from log groups. Each log group matching the `log_group_name_prefix` requires a worker to keep log ingestion as close to real-time as possible. For example, if `log_group_name_prefix` matches five log groups, then `number_of_workers` should be set to `5`. The default value is `1`.

## Logs reference

The `firewall_logs` dataset collects AWS Network Firewall logs. Users can use these logs to
monitor network activity.
