# Amazon EBS

The Amazon EBS integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)—a block-storage service designed for Amazon EC2.

Use the Amazon EBS integration to collect metrics related to your Amazon EBS storage.
Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to collect five-minute metrics on read operations, read bytes, and total read time. Then you can send an email alert if the volume of operations, bytes, or read time exceeds a predefined threshold.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The Amazon EBS integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of Amazon EBS.
The metrics collected by the Amazon EBS integration include read operations, read bytes, total read time, queue length, idle time, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference)

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from Amazon EBS.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
{{ url "getting-started-observability" "Getting started" }} guide.

## Metrics reference

The `ebs` data stream collects EBS metrics from AWS.
An example event for `ebs` looks like this:
