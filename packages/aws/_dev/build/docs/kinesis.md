# Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

The Amazon Kinesis integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Kinesis Data Stream](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/)â€”
a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale.

Use the Amazon Kinesis integration to monitor Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create 
alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The Amazon Kinesis integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of Amazon Kinesis.
Metrics collected by this integration include information about operations related to Amazon Kinesis records, shards, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon Kinesis service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
