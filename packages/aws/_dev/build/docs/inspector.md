# Inspector

The [Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/) integration collects and parses data from Amazon Inspector [Findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/v2/APIReference/API_ListFindings.html) REST APIs.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

## Compatibility
This module is tested against `Amazon Inspector API version 2.0`.

## Agentless-enabled integration

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

## To collect data from Amazon Inspector API, users must have an Access Key and a Secret Key. To create API token follow below steps:

  1. Login to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
  2. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ to access the IAM console.
  3. On the navigation menu, choose Users.
  4. Choose your IAM user name.
  5. Select Create access key from the Security Credentials tab.
  6. To see the new access key, choose Show.

## Note

  - For the current integration package, it is compulsory to add Secret Access Key and Access Key ID.
  - This data stream doesn't support setting a Role ARN.
  - Ensure your IAM has the `inspector2:ListFindings` permission granted. Without this permission, API requests will be denied.

## Troubleshooting

### Breaking Changes

#### Support for Elastic Vulnerability Findings page.

Version `4.0.0` of the AWS integration adds support for [Elastic Cloud Security workflow](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/cloud/ingest-third-party-cloud-security-data#_ingest_third_party_security_posture_and_vulnerability_data). The enhancement enables the users of AWS Inspector integration to ingest their enriched vulnerabilities from Amazon Inspector platform into Elastic and get insights directly from Elastic [Vulnerability Findings page](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/cloud/findings-page-3).
This update adds [Elastic Latest Transform](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-overview#latest-transform-overview) which copies the latest vulnerability findings from source indices matching the pattern `logs-aws.inspector-*` into new destination indices matching the pattern `security_solution-aws.vulnerability_latest-*`. The Elastic Vulnerability Findings page will display vulnerabilities based on the destination indices.

For existing users of AWS integration, before upgrading to `4.0.0` please ensure following requirements are met:

1. Users need [Elastic Security solution](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security) which has requirements documented [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/get-started/elastic-security-requirements).
2. To use transforms, users must have:
   - at least one [transform node](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/clusters-nodes-shards/node-roles#transform-node-role),
   - management features visible in the Kibana space, and
   - security privileges that:
     - grant use of transforms, and
     - grant access to source and destination indices
   For more details on Transform Setup, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-setup)
3. Because the latest copy of vulnerabilities is now indexed in two places, that is, in both source and destination indices, users must anticipate storage requirements accordingly.
