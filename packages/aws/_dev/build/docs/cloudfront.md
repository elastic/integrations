# CloudFront

The AWS CloudFront integration allows you to monitor your [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) usage.

Use the AWS CloudFront integration to collect and parse logs related to content delivery.
Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong,
and reference logs when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use the data from this integration to know when there are more than some number of failed requests
for a single piece of content in a given time period. You could also use the data to troubleshoot the underlying issue by
looking at additional context in the logs like the number of unique users (by IP address) who experienced the issue,
the source of the request, and more.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS CloudFront integration collects one type of data: logs.

**Logs** help you keep a record of every user request that CloudFront receives.
These logs are useful for many scenarios, including security and access audits.
See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

## Requirements

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS CloudFront service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the
**AWS** integration. When you configure the AWS integration,
you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
{{ url "getting-started-observability" "Getting started" }} guide.

## Logs reference

The `cloudfront` data stream collects standard logs (also called access logs) from AWS CloudFront.
CloudFront standard logs provide detailed records about every request thatâ€™s made to a distribution.
