# AWS Transit Gateway

The AWS Transit Gateway integration allows you to monitor [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway)â€”a service that connects networks to a single gateway.

Use the AWS Transit Gateway integration collect metrics related to traffic routed between VPCs and on-premises networks. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to track the number of packets dropped because they did not match a route. Then set up anomaly detection to alert when the number of packets dropped spikes.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS Transit Gateway integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of AWS Transit Gateway.
Metrics collected by the AWS Transit Gateway integration include the number of bytes sent from the transit gateway, the number of bytes received from the transit gateway, the number of packets dropped because they did not match a route, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS Transit Gateway service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.
