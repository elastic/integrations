# S3

The S3 integration allows you to monitor Amazon S3. Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) is a scalable service for storing and retrieving data. The data can be accessed via a web interface or an API.

Use the S3 integration to to collect logs and metrics related to the data stored in your Amazon S3 buckets. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference logs and metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could you could use this data to view access logs, the amount of data stored in a bucket, and the amount of data download requests. Then you can alert the relevant project manager to any significant changes by email.

## Data streams

The S3 integration collects two types of data streams: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in Amazon S3.
Log data streams collected by the S3 integration include the apparent internet address of the requester, the name of the bucket that the request was processed and more. See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of Amazon S3.
Metric data streams collected by the S3 integration include the latency (elapsed per-request time from the first byte received to the last byte sent to an Amazon S3 bucket), the  number of HTTP 4xx client error status code requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

<!-- etc. -->

<!-- Optional notes -->

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

<!-- Other requirements -->

 Before using any AWS integration you will need:

 * **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
 * **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

 For more details about these requirements, see the **AWS** integration documentation.

## Setup

<!-- Any prerequisite instructions -->

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

<!-- Additional set up instructions -->

 Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon S3 service.

 If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
 When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

## Logs reference
The `s3access` dataset collects server access logs from Amazon S3. Server access 
logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. 
Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log 
information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help users
to learn about customer base and understand Amazon S3 bill.

Please follow [how to enable server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html#server-access-logging-overview)
for sending server access logs to S3 bucket.
