# Amazon S3

The Amazon S3 integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)â€”an object storage service.

Use the Amazon S3 integration to collect logs and metrics related to the data stored in your Amazon S3 buckets. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference logs and metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this data to view access logs, the amount of data stored in a bucket, and the amount of data download requests. Then you can alert the relevant project manager to any significant changes by email.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The S3 integration collects two types of data: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in your Amazon services.
Logs collected by the S3 integration include the apparent internet address of the requester, the name of the bucket that the request was processed, and more. See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of different Amazon services.
Metrics collected by the S3 integration include S3 daily storage, S3 requests, the latency (elapsed per-request time from the first byte received to the last byte sent to an Amazon S3 bucket), the number of HTTP 4xx client error status code requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon S3 service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the {{ url "getting-started-observability" "Getting started" }} guide.

To enable S3 request metrics, see [Create a CloudWatch metrics configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html).

To send server access logs to an S3 bucket, see [How to enable server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html#server-access-logging-overview).

## Logs reference

The `s3access` dataset collects server access logs from Amazon S3. Server access
logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket.
Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log
information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help users
to learn about customer base and understand Amazon S3 bill.
