## Logs

### s3_logs_generic
The `s3_logs` dataset is a generic input to ingest logs from S3 objects that are
pointed to by S3 notification events read from an SQS queue or directly polling
list of S3 objects from an S3 bucket. The use of SQS notification is preferred:
polling list of S3 objects is expensive in terms of performance and costs and
should be preferably use only when no SQS notification can be attached to the S3
buckets. This dataset also supports S3 notification from SNS to SQS.

### s3access
The `s3access` dataset collects server access logs from AWS S3. Server access 
logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. 
Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log 
information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help users
to learn about customer base and understand Amazon S3 bill.

Please follow [how to enable server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html#server-access-logging-overview)
for sending server access logs to S3 bucket.
