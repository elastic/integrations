    # if you have multiple fields with cardinality, and you want those field to be linked (meaning that for field1/valueX you want always field2/valueY) you have to set as cardinality of each linked fields the LCM of their size.
    # what is their size? for enum is the length of the enum list, for integer is the range, etc. where you don't have a fixed length (like text or integer with a range), you won't consider it in the calculation for the LCM:
    # you just decide how many different values you want to have, as long as the number fits the LCM of the fields with a size, and you set this as the cardinality, or set the cardinality as the LCM.
    # in this case we have: `dimensionType` (40), `region` (15), `instanceTypeIdx`/`InstanceType`/`instanceCoreCount`/`instanceThreadPerCore` (20),
    # `instanceMonitoringState`/`instancePrivateDnsEmpty`/`instanceStateName` (10) and `instancePublicDnsEmpty` (5): the result is 120
