    - name: terminating_rule_match_details
      type: nested
      description: |
        Detailed information about the terminating rule that matched the request. A terminating rule has an action that ends the inspection process against a web request. Possible actions for a terminating rule are ALLOW and BLOCK. This is only populated for SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) match rule statements. As with all rule statements that inspect for more than one thing, AWS WAF applies the action on the first match and stops inspecting the web request. A web request with a terminating action could contain other threats, in addition to the one reported in the log.
