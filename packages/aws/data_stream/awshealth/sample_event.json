            "event_description": "We are following up on a previous notification regarding changes to the Docker version used in the Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Optimized Amazon Machine Imagines (AMI) based on Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). If you are running the Amazon ECS-Optimized AL2023 AMIs, which are on the latest Docker version, you can disregard this message.\n\nDocker version 20.10.25 reached its end-of-life in December 2023 and will not receive any further security updates. We are changing the default version of Docker in the ECS-Optimized AL2 AMI to 25.0.3 with a staged release. This is a major version bump in Docker and contains backwards incompatible changes. Please make sure to test your application after applying this update.\n\nOn June 12, 2024, as communicated previously, we will disable automatic security updates at instance launch for ECS-Optimized AL2 AMIs. On June 19, 2024, we will release Docker 25.0.3 to the Amazon ECS Extras Repository without being tagged as a security advisory. This will allow customers who update in place, to manually update their instances with the command 'yum update docker' to complete any necessary acceptance testing. On July 11, 2024, we will release a new version of the ECS-Optimized AL2 AMI with Docker 25.0.3. For customers that choose not to update in place, we recommend moving to this AMI to get the update. ECS-Optimized AL2 AMI versions released between June 12, 2024 and July 11, 2024 will not receive the new Docker version and your action will be required to receive security updates to Docker. We recommend you update to an ECS-Optimized AL2 AMI released on July 11, 2024 or later.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, we will tag Docker 25.0.3 as a security update. This will trigger AMIs released prior to June 12, 2024 to automatically update the Docker version to Docker 25.0.3 at instance launch unless you have taken steps to disable this functionality [1].\n\nUpdating in place to Docker 25.0.3 will also update the ecs-init package to the latest available. Docker 25.0.3 is only compatible with ecs-init version 1.81 or later. As a best practice, and to ensure you are receiving the latest package versions and updates, we recommend customers update to the latest Amazon ECS-Optimized AMIs, which are released weekly.\n\nA list of your impacted resources can be found in the 'Affected resources' tab.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please contact AWS Support [2].\n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html\n[2] https://aws.amazon.com/support",
