          The maximum number of SQS messages that can be inflight at any time. Defaults to 5. When processing large
          amount of large size S3 objects and each object has large amount of events, if this parameter sets too high,
          it can cause the input to process too many messages concurrently, overload the agent and cause ingest failure.
          We recommend to keep the default value 5 and use the [preset](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/es-output-settings.html#es-output-settings-performance-tuning-settings)
          option to tune your Elastic Agent performance. You can optimize for throughput, scale, latency, or you can
          choose a balanced (the default) set of performance specifications.
