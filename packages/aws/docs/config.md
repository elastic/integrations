# Config

[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/) provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

Use this integration to collect and parse data from your AWS Config APIs. Visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference data when troubleshooting an issue.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS Config integration collects one type of data: logs.

**Logs** help you keep a record of the findings in AWS Config, allowing you to track and audit compliance status of your resources.

The AWS Config integration works by first retrieving all config rules using the [DescribeConfigRules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeConfigRules.html) API. Then, for each specific config rule, the integration fetches its evaluation results using the [GetComplianceDetailsByConfigRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_GetComplianceDetailsByConfigRule.html) API. These evaluation results enrich their respective config rules, ultimately producing a finding log.

See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

## Requirements

### Agentless Enabled Integration
Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).
Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

### Agent Based Installation
- Elastic Agent must be installed
- You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
- Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the REST API and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS Config service.

### To collect data from AWS Config APIs, users must have an Access Key and a Secret Key. To create API token follow below steps:

1. Login to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
2. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ to access the IAM console.
3. On the navigation menu, choose Users.
4. Choose your IAM user name.
5. Select Create access key from the Security Credentials tab.
6. To see the new access key, choose Show.

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:

1. In Kibana navigate to Management > Integrations.
2. In "Search for integrations" top bar, search for `AWS Config`.
3. Select the "AWS Config" integration from the search results.
4. Select "Add AWS Config" to add the integration.
5. Add all the required integration configuration parameters, including the aws_region to enable data collection.
6. Select "Save and continue" to save the integration.

**Note**
1. For the current integration package, it is compulsory to add Secret Access Key and Access Key ID.
2. The AWS Config integration performs a full ingestion of all findings during each interval.

## Troubleshooting

### Breaking Changes

#### Support for Elastic Misconfiguration Findings page.

Version `4.0.0` of the AWS Config integration adds support for [Elastic Cloud Security workflow](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/cloud/ingest-third-party-cloud-security-data#_ingest_third_party_security_posture_and_vulnerability_data). The enhancement enables the users of AWS Config integration to ingest misconfiguration findings from AWS Config platform into Elastic and get insights directly from [Misconfiguration Findings page](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/cloud/findings-page).
Version `4.0.0` adds [Elastic Latest Transform](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-overview#latest-transform-overview) which copies the latest findings from source indices matching the pattern `logs-aws.config-*` into new destination indices matching the pattern `security_solution-awsconfig.misconfiguration_latest-*`. The Elastic Findings pages will display findings based on the destination indices.

For existing users of AWS Config integration, before upgrading to version `4.0.0` please ensure following requirements are met:

1. Users need [Elastic Security solution](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security) which has requirements documented [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/security/get-started/elastic-security-requirements).
2. To use transforms, users must have:
   - at least one [transform node](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/clusters-nodes-shards/node-roles#transform-node-role),
   - management features visible in the Kibana space, and
   - security privileges that:
     - grant use of transforms, and
     - grant access to source and destination indices
   For more details on Transform Setup, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-setup)
3. Because the latest copy of findings is now indexed in two places, that is, in both source and destination indices, users must anticipate storage requirements accordingly.

| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset. | long |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | constant_keyword |
| resource.id |  | keyword |
| resource.type |  | keyword |
| result.evaluation |  | keyword |
| rule.tags |  | keyword |
