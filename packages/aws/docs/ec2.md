# Amazon EC2

The Amazon EC2 integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)â€”a cloud compute platform.

Use the Amazon EC2 integration to collect logs and metrics related to your EC2 instances. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference the logs and metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this data to track Amazon EC2 CPU utilization. Then you can alert when utilization for an instance crosses a predefined threshold.

## Data streams

The Amazon EC2 integration collects two types of data: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in Amazon EC2.
Logs collected by the Amazon EC2 integration include the region in which an instance is running, the operating system architecture, container information, and more. See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of your Amazon EC2 instances.
Metrics collected by the Amazon EC2 integration include the Amazon EC2 instance ID, the number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, see the **AWS** integration documentation.

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon EC2 service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Logs reference

The `ec2` data stream supports both EC2 logs stored in AWS CloudWatch and EC2 logs stored in Amazon S3.
For logs stored in S3, you must export logs from log groups to an Amazon S3 bucket which has SQS notification setup already.

With this data stream, EC2 logs will be parsed into fields like  `ip_address`
and `process.name`. For logs from other services, please use the **AWS CloudWatch** integration.

| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |

| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| process.name | Process name. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
