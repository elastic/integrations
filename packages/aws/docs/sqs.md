# AWS SQS

The AWS SQS integration allows you to monitor [Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)â€”a managed message queuing service.

Use the AWS SQS integration to view metrics on messages sent, stored, and received via Amazon SQS. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could track the number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. Then create an alert to be notified if the queue reaches a certain size.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The SQS integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of AWS SQS.
Metrics collected by the AWS SQS integration include the number of messages that are in flight, the number of ReceiveMessage API calls that did not return a message, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS SQS service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.
