# AWS API Gateway

The AWS API Gateway integration allows you to monitor [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) â€” a centralized API management service.

Use the AWS API Gateway integration to collect metrics related to your HTTP, REST or WebSockets APIs. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to examine metrics related to error rates, response codes, and latency. You can pinpoint problematic areas, identify error-prone API endpoints, and troubleshoot performance issues.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The API Gateway integration collects one type of data: metrics.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of API Gateway.
Metrics collected by the AWS API Gateway integration include the number of client and server errors, request and error counts and cache counts.

See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS API Gateway service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.
