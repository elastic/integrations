# S3

## Logs
The `s3access` dataset collects server access logs from AWS S3. Server access 
logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. 
Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log 
information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help users
to learn about customer base and understand Amazon S3 bill.

Please follow [how to enable server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html#server-access-logging-overview)
for sending server access logs to S3 bucket.
