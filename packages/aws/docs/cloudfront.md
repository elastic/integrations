# CloudFront

The AWS CloudFront integration allows you to monitor your [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) usage.

Use the AWS CloudFront integration to collect and parse logs related to content delivery.
Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong,
and reference logs when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use the data from this integration to know when there are more than some number of failed requests
for a single piece of content in a given time period. You could also use the data to troubleshoot the underlying issue by
looking at additional context in the logs like the number of unique users (by IP address) who experienced the issue,
the source of the request, and more.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS CloudFront integration collects one type of data: logs.

**Logs** help you keep a record of every user request that CloudFront receives.
These logs are useful for many scenarios, including security and access audits.
See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

## Requirements

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS CloudFront service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the
**AWS** integration. When you configure the AWS integration,
you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Logs reference

The `cloudfront` data stream collects standard logs (also called access logs) from AWS CloudFront.
CloudFront standard logs provide detailed records about every request that’s made to a distribution.

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| aws.cloudfront.domain | The domain name of the CloudFront distribution (for example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net). | keyword |
| aws.cloudfront.edge_detailed_result_type | When the value of the x-edge-result-type field is Error, this field contains the specific type of error. When the object was served to the viewer from the Origin Shield cache, this field contains OriginShieldHit. In all other cases, this field contains the same value as x-edge-result-type. | keyword |
| aws.cloudfront.edge_location | The edge location that served the request. Each edge location is identified by a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number (for example, DFW3). The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code for an airport near the edge location’s geographic location. | keyword |
| aws.cloudfront.edge_response_result_type | How the server classified the response just before returning the response to the viewer. See also the x-edge-result-type field. | keyword |
| aws.cloudfront.edge_result_type | How the server classified the response after the last byte left the server. In some cases, the result type can change between the time that the server is ready to send the response and the time that it finishes sending the response.  See also the x-edge-response-result-type field. For example, in HTTP streaming, suppose the server finds a segment of the stream in the cache. In that scenario, the value of this field would ordinarily be Hit.  However, if the viewer closes the connection before the server has delivered the entire segment, the final result type (and the value of this field) is Error. WebSocket connections will have a value of Miss for this field because the content is not cacheable and is proxied directly to the origin. | keyword |
| aws.cloudfront.range_end | When the response contains the HTTP Content-Range header, this field contains the range end value. | long |
| aws.cloudfront.range_start | When the response contains the HTTP Content-Range header, this field contains the range start value. | long |
| aws.cloudfront.time_to_first_byte | The number of seconds between receiving the request and writing the first byte of the response, as measured on the server. | float |
| aws.edge_location | The edge location that served the request. Each edge location is identified by a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number (for example, DFW3). The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code for an airport near the edge location’s geographic location. | alias |
| aws.s3.bucket.arn | The AWS S3 bucket ARN. | keyword |
| aws.s3.bucket.name | The AWS S3 bucket name. | keyword |

| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.domain | The domain name of the destination system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If `event.start` and `event.end` are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |

| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | keyword |

| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.bytes | Total size in bytes of the request (body and headers). | long |
| http.request.id | A unique identifier for each HTTP request to correlate logs between clients and servers in transactions. The id may be contained in a non-standard HTTP header, such as `X-Request-ID` or `X-Correlation-ID`. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| http.response.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the response body. | long |
| http.response.bytes | Total size in bytes of the response (body and headers). | long |
| http.response.mime_type | Mime type of the body of the response. This value must only be populated based on the content of the response body, not on the `Content-Type` header. Comparing the mime type of a response with the response's Content-Type header can be helpful in detecting misconfigured servers. | keyword |
| http.response.status_code | HTTP response status code. | long |
| http.version | HTTP version. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |

| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| tls.cipher | String indicating the cipher used during the current connection. | keyword |
| tls.version | Numeric part of the version parsed from the original string. | keyword |
| tls.version_protocol | Normalized lowercase protocol name parsed from original string. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.full.text | Multi-field of `url.full`. | match_only_text |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| url.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.original.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.original`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.full`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name.text | Multi-field of `user_agent.os.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| user_agent.version | Version of the user agent. | keyword |
