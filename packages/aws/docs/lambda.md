# AWS Lambda

The AWS Lambda integration allows you to monitor [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)â€”a serverless compute service.

Use the AWS Lambda integration to collect metrics related to your [Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/#AWS_Lambda_functions). Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this integration to track throttled lambda functions, alert the relevant project manager, and then increase your account's concurrency limit.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

## Data streams

The AWS Lambda integration collects metrics and logs.

**Logs** provide detailed information about the execution of AWS Lambda functions.
They include invocation events, function output, error messages, stack traces, initialization logs, and AWS-generated reports. These logs help you troubleshoot issues, analyze performance, and monitor the behavior of your Lambda functions during runtime.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of AWS Lambda.
Metrics collected by the AWS Lambda integration include the number of times your function code is executed, the amount of time that your function code spends processing an event, the number of invocations that result in a function error, and more.

See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Event Source Mapping Metrics

This integration can also collect Event Source Mapping (ESM) metrics, which track how your Lambda function processes records from event sources like Amazon SQS, DynamoDB, or Kinesis. 

To collect these metrics, you must:  
1. Enable Event Source Mapping for your Lambda function by following the steps outlined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics-types.html#event-source-mapping-metrics).  
2. Enable the configuration flag `Collect Event Source Mapping metrics`.  

Important notes:
- Enabling this feature may incur additional costs
- Not all metrics are available for every event source type
- Metric collection may be affected by CloudWatch or Lambda service availability

See more details about [Event Source Mapping Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics-types.html#event-source-mapping-metrics).

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, please take a look at the [AWS integration documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the AWS Lambda service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/starting-with-the-elasticsearch-platform-and-its-solutions/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

To enable AWS Lambda logs, ensure that your function's execution role includes the necessary permissions to write to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Specifically, the role should have the following permissions: 
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`
- `logs:CreateLogStream`
- `logs:PutLogEvents` 

You can grant these permissions by attaching the AWS managed policy `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` to your function's execution role.

By default, AWS Lambda automatically streams logs to CloudWatch Logs. You can view these logs by navigating to the AWS Lambda console, selecting your function, and choosing the "Monitor" tab. From there, click on "View CloudWatch logs" to access the logs in the CloudWatch console.

For more detailed information, refer to the AWS documentation on [Sending Lambda function logs to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html).
