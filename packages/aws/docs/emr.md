# Amazon EMR (ElasticMapReduce)

The Amazon EMR integration allows you to monitor [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) — a fully managed big data processing and analytics service.

Use the Amazon EMR integration to collect metrics related to your EMR instances. Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong, and reference the metrics when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, you could use this data to track Amazon EMR cluster progress and cluster storage. Then you can alert when utilization for an instance crosses a predefined threshold.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on AWS API requests will be generated by this integration. Please refer to the AWS integration for more details.**

## Data streams

The Amazon EMR integration collects two types of data: metrics and logs.

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of Amazon EMR.
The metrics collected by the Amazon EMR integration include cluster progress, cluster state, cluster or node storage, and more. See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference)

**Logs** help you keep a record of events happening in Amazon EMR.
Logs collected by the Amazon EMR integration include the cluster status, node status details and more. 

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Before using any AWS integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, see the **AWS** integration documentation.

## Setup

Use this integration if you only need to collect data from the Amazon EMR service.

If you want to collect data from two or more AWS services, consider using the **AWS** integration.
When you configure the AWS integration, you can collect data from as many AWS services as you'd like.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.
