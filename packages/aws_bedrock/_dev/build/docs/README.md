# Amazon Bedrock

## Overview

[Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/index.html) offers a fully managed service that provides access to high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI startups and Amazon through a unified API. You can choose from a wide variety of foundation models to find the one that best fits your specific use case. With Amazon Bedrock, you gain access to robust tools for building generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI practices. Amazon Bedrock enables you to easily experiment with and evaluate top foundation models, customize them privately with your data using methods like fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and develop agents that perform tasks by leveraging your enterprise systems and data sources.

The Amazon Bedrock integration enables a seamless connection of your model to Elastic to efficiently collect and monitor invocation logs and runtime metrics.

Elastic Security can leverage this data for security analytics including
correlation, visualization and incident response. With invocation logging, you
can collect the full request and response data, and any metadata associated with
use of your account.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

### Compatibility

This integration is compatible with the Amazon Bedrock `ModelInvocationLog` schema,
version 1.0.

## What data does this integration collect?

The Amazon Bedrock integration collects model invocation logs and runtime metrics.

Data streams:
 - `invocation`: Collects invocation logs, model input data, and model output
   data for all invocations in your AWS account used in Amazon Bedrock.
 - `runtime`: Collects Amazon Bedrock runtime metrics such as model invocation
   count, invocation latency, input token count, output token count and many
   more.   
 - `guardrails`: Collects Amazon Bedrock Guardrails metrics such as guardrail invocation
count, guardrail invocation latency, text unit utilization count, guardrail policy types associated with interventions and many more.

## What do I need to use this integration?

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for
visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on
Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your
own hardware.

Before using any Amazon Bedrock integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has
  permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, check the [AWS
integration
documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

* Elastic Agent must be installed. For detailed guidance, follow these [instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).
* You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
* Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the S3 bucket and ship the
  data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed through the
  integration's ingest pipelines.

## Setup

To use the Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs, the logging model
invocation logging must be enabled and be sent to a log store destination,
either S3 or CloudWatch. For more details, check the
[Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html).

1. Set up an [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#setup-s3-destination) or [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#setup-cloudwatch-logs-destination) destination.
2. Enable logging. You can do it either through the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#model-invocation-logging-console) or [the Amazon Bedrock API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#using-apis-logging). 

## Logs

### Collecting Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs from S3 bucket

When log collection from an S3 bucket is enabled, you can access logs from S3 objects referenced by S3 notification events received through an SQS queue or by directly polling the list of S3 objects within the bucket.

The use of SQS notification is preferred: polling list of S3 objects is 
expensive in terms of performance and costs and should be used only 
when no SQS notification can be attached to the S3 buckets. This input 
integration also supports S3 notification from SNS to SQS.

To enable the SQS notification method, set the `queue_url` configuration value. To enable the S3 bucket list polling method, configure both the `bucket_arn` and number_of_workers values. Note that `queue_url` and `bucket_arn` cannot be set simultaneously, and at least one of these values must be specified.

### Collecting Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs from CloudWatch

When CloudWatch log collection is enabled, you can retrieve logs from all log streams within a specified log group. The filterLogEvents AWS API is used to list log events from the specified log group.

## Metrics

### Runtime Metrics

Amazon Bedrock runtime metrics include `Invocations`, `InvocationLatency`,
`InvocationClientErrors`, `InvocationServerErrors`, `OutputTokenCount`,
`OutputImageCount`, `InvocationThrottles`. These metrics can be used for various use cases including: 
 - Comparing model latency 
 - Measuring input and output token counts
 - Detecting the number of invocations that the system throttled

### Guardrails Metrics

Amazon Bedrock guardrail metrics include `Invocations`, `InvocationLatency`, `InvocationClientErrors`, `InvocationServerErrors`, `InvocationThrottles`, `TextUnitCount`, and `InvocationsIntervened`. These metrics enable several use cases, such as:

- Monitoring the latency of guardrail invocations
- Tracking the number of text units consumed by guardrail policies
- Detecting invocations where guardrails intervened
