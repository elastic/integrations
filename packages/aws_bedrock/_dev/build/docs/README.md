# Amazon Bedrock

## Overview

[Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/index.html) is a fully managed
service that makes high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI
startups and Amazon available for your use through a unified API. You can choose
from a wide range of foundation models to find the model that is best suited for
your use case. Amazon Bedrock also offers a broad set of capabilities to build
generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using
Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top foundation
models for your use cases, privately customize them with your data using
techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and
build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources.

The Amazon Bedrock integration allows you to easily connect your Amazon Bedrock model
invocation logging and runtime metrics to Elastic for seamless collection of
invocation logs and runtime metrics to monitor usage. 

Elastic Security can leverage this data for security analytics including
correlation, visualization and incident response. With invocation logging, you
can collect the full request and response data, and any metadata associated with
use of your account.

**IMPORTANT: Extra AWS charges on API requests will be generated by this integration. Check [API Requests](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/aws#api-requests) for more details.**

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with the Amazon Bedrock `ModelInvocationLog` schema,
version 1.0.

## Data streams

The Amazon Bedrock integration collects model invocation logs and runtime metrics.

Data streams:
 - `invocation`: Collects invocation logs, model input data, and model output
   data for all invocations in your AWS account used in Amazon Bedrock.
 - `runtime`: Collects Amazon Bedrock runtime metrics such as model invocation
   count, invocation latency, input token count, output token count and many
   more.   

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for
visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on
Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your
own hardware.

Before using any Amazon Bedrock integration you will need:

* **AWS Credentials** to connect with your AWS account.
* **AWS Permissions** to make sure the user you're using to connect has
  permission to share the relevant data.

For more details about these requirements, check the [AWS
integration
documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/aws#requirements).

- Elastic Agent must be installed.
- You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
- Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the S3 bucket and ship the
  data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the
  integration's ingest pipelines.

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent

To install and manage an Elastic Agent you have the following options:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended)

You install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to
define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend
using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your
agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users)

You install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent
locally on the system where it is installed. You are responsible for managing
and upgrading the agents. This approach is for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or
standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available
from the Elastic Docker registry, and we provide deployment manifests for
running on Kubernetes.

To run Elastic Agent, check these [requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

## Setup

To use the Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs, the logging model
invocation logging must be enabled and be sent to a log store destination,
either S3 or CloudWatch. For more details check the
[Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html).

1. Set up an [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#setup-s3-destination) or [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#setup-cloudwatch-logs-destination) destination.
2. Enable logging. You can do it either through the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#model-invocation-logging-console) or [the Amazon Bedrock API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html#using-apis-logging). 

## Logs

### Collecting Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs from S3 bucket

When collecting logs from S3 bucket is enabled, you can retrieve logs from S3
objects that are pointed to by S3 notification events read from an SQS queue or
directly polling list of S3 objects in an S3 bucket. 

The use of SQS notification is preferred: polling list of S3 objects is 
expensive in terms of performance and costs and should be preferably used only 
when no SQS notification can be attached to the S3 buckets. This input 
integration also supports S3 notification from SNS to SQS.

SQS notification method is enabled setting `queue_url` configuration value. S3 
bucket list polling method is enabled setting `bucket_arn` configuration value
and `number_of_workers` value. Both `queue_url` and `bucket_arn` cannot be set 
at the same time and at least one of the two value must be set.

### Collecting Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs from CloudWatch

When collecting logs from CloudWatch is enabled, you can retrieve logs from 
all log streams in a specific log group. `filterLogEvents` AWS API is used to 
list log events from the specified log group.

## Metrics

### Runtime Metrics

Amazon Bedrock runtime metrics include `Invocations`, `InvocationLatency`,
`InvocationClientErrors`, `InvocationServerErrors`, `OutputTokenCount`,
`OutputImageCount`, `InvocationThrottles`. These metrics can be used for various use cases including: 
 - Comparing model latency 
 - Measuring input and output token counts
 - Detecting the number of invocations that the system throttled
