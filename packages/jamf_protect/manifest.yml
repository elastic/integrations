              Jamf Protect is an S3-compatible, globally distributed object storage. This parameter can replace Bucket ARN and Access Point ARN with a Bucket Name for collecting logs from Jamf Protect or another 3rd party S3-compatible service. This is a global setting which can be overriden by specific local bucket names for each data stream if required.
              Using non-AWS S3 compatible buckets requires the use of Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for authentication. To specify the non-AWS S3 bucket name, use the non_aws_bucket_name config and the endpoint must be set to replace the default API endpoint.
