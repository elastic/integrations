For example, syslog details belong under `log.syslog.*`.\nThe details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`, but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields."

      description: "Original log level of the log event.\nIf the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).\nSome examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`."
