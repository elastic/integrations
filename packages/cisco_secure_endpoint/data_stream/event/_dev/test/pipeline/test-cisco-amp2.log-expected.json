Scripting is useful for speeding up operational tasks and reducing the time required to gain access to critical resources. Some scripting languages may be used to bypass process monitoring mechanisms by directly interacting with the operating system at an API level instead of calling other programs. Common scripting languages for Windows include VBScript and \u003ca href=\\\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086\\\"\u003ePowerShell\u003c/a\u003e but could also be in the form of command-line batch scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eScripts can be embedded inside Office documents as macros that can be set to execute when files used in \u003ca href=\\\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193\\\"\u003eSpearphishing Attachment\u003c/a\u003e and other types of spearphishing are opened. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of execution than software exploitation through \u003ca href=\\\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203\\\"\u003eExploitation for Client Execution\u003c/a\u003e, where adversaries will rely on macros being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\\n\u003cp\u003eMany popular offensive frameworks exist which use forms of scripting for security testers and adversaries alike. Metasploit (Citation: Metasploit_Ref), Veil (Citation: Veil_Ref), and PowerSploit (Citation: Powersploit) are three examples that are popular among penetration testers for exploit and post-compromise operations and include many features for evading defenses. Some adversaries are known to use PowerShell.
