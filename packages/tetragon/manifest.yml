  Cilium Tetragon is an open-source security observability tool that leverages
  eBPF technology to provide real-time visibility and monitoring for
  containerized applications, especially in Kubernetes environments. It tracks
  system-level events such as process execution, file access, and network
  activity without the need for intrusive kernel modules. Tetragon also helps
  detect and respond to suspicious behaviors at runtime, offering enhanced
  security enforcement. By integrating with Kubernetes, it enables deep
  visibility into workloads and supports the enforcement of fine-grained
  security policies.
