# Microsoft Intune Integration for Elastic

## Overview

[Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/security/business/microsoft-intune) is a cloud-based endpoint management solution that helps organizations manage and secure their devices, applications, and data. It provides comprehensive mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) capabilities for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices.

The Microsoft Intune integration for Elastic allows you to collect managed device logs using [Azure Event Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/), then visualize the data in Kibana. This integration provides visibility into device management activities, policy compliance, application deployments, and security events across your Intune-managed environment.

### Compatibility

The Microsoft Intune integration uses Azure Event Hub to collect managed device logs from Microsoft Intune.

### How it works

This integration collects managed device logs from Microsoft Intune by consuming events from an Azure Event Hub. Intune managed device logs are forwarded to the Event Hub, and the Elastic Agent reads these events in real-time, processes them through ingest pipelines, and indexes them in Elasticsearch.

## What data does this integration collect?

This integration collects Microsoft Intune managed device logs.

### Supported use cases

Integrating device inventory data into SIEM dashboards delivers centralized visibility into endpoint posture, compliance status, and hardware distribution. The dashboard highlights OS, ownership, manufacturer, and model trends, along with enrollment and activity patterns over time. Compliance insights and status breakdowns help quickly assess policy adherence, while detailed inventory tables provide key device attributes for operational and investigative context. Together, these views support effective endpoint monitoring, compliance management, and governance.

## What do I need to use this integration?

### Collect data from Microsoft Azure Event Hub

-  Set up Azure Event Hub for Intune managed device logs and send managed device logs from Intune to Azure Event Hub. For more detail, refer to the link [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/review-logs-using-azure-monitor).
- **Note:** Select LOG > IntuneDevices.

## How do I deploy this integration?

This integration supports Agent-based installations.

### Agent-based installation

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

### configure

1. In Kibana navigate to **Management** > **Integrations**.
2. In the search bar, type **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Select the **Microsoft Intune** integration and add it.
4. While adding the integration, to collect logs via **Azure Event Hub**, enter the following details:
   - eventhub
   - consumer_group
   - connection_string
   - storage_account
   - storage_account_key
   - storage_account_container (optional)
   - resource_manager_endpoint (optional)
5. Select **Save and continue** to save the integration.

### Validation

#### Dashboards populated

1. In the top search bar in Kibana, search for **Dashboards**.
2. In the search bar, type **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Select a dashboard for the dataset you are collecting, and verify the dashboard information is populated.
