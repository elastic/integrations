# Cyera Integration for Elastic

## Overview

[Cyera](https://www.cyera.com/) is a cloud data security platform (DSPM – Data Security Posture Management). It focuses on discovering, classifying, monitoring, and protecting sensitive data across cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, SaaS, M365, Snowflake, etc.).

The Cyera integration for Elastic allows you to collect logs and visualize the data in Kibana.

### Compatibility

This integration is compatible with different versions of Cyera APIs for respective data streams as below:

| Data streams   | Version |
|----------------|---------|
| Classification | v1      |
| Issue          | v3      |
| Event          | v1      |

### How it works

This integration periodically queries the Cyera API to retrieve classifications, issues and events.

## What data does this integration collect?

This integration collects log messages of the following types:

- `Classification`: Collects classifications that have been identified by the Cyera system.

- `Issue`: Collects issues that have been identified by the Cyera system.

- `Event`: Collects all events from the Cyera system.

### Supported use cases
Integrating Cyera Classification, Issues, and Events data streams with Elastic SIEM provides visibility into sensitive data, the risks tied to that data, and the security events triggered across cloud and SaaS environments. By correlating Cyera’s classification intelligence with issue context and event activity in Elastic analytics, security teams can strengthen data security posture, accelerate incident response, and simplify compliance. Dashboards in Kibana present breakdowns by sensitivity, category, severity, status, risk status, event type, and trends over time — enabling faster investigations, better prioritization, and improved accountability.

## What do I need to use this integration?

### From Elastic

This integration installs [Elastic latest transforms](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-overview#latest-transform-overview). For more details, check the [Transform](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/transforms/transform-setup) setup and requirements.

### From Cyera

While collecting data through the Cyera APIs, authentication is handled using a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, which serve as the required credentials. Any requests made without credentials will be rejected by the Cyera APIs.

#### Obtain `Credentials`:

- Generate a Cyera API client, retrieve the Client ID and Client Secret.
- Confirm your Cyera API URL, a default is loaded in the configuration.

## How do I deploy this integration?

This integration supports both Elastic Agentless-based and Agent-based installations.

### Agentless-based installation

Agentless integrations allow you to collect data without having to manage Elastic Agent in your cloud. They make manual agent deployment unnecessary, so you can focus on your data instead of the agent that collects it. For more information, refer to [Agentless integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/security-agentless-integrations.html) and the [Agentless integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/agentless-integration-troubleshooting.html).

Agentless deployments are only supported in Elastic Serverless and Elastic Cloud environments. This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

### Agent-based installation

Elastic Agent must be installed. For more details, check the Elastic Agent [installation instructions](docs-content://reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.

## Setup

1. In the top search bar in Kibana, search for **Integrations**.
2. In the search bar, type **Cyera**.
3. Select the **Cyera** integration from the search results.
4. Select **Add Cyera** to add the integration.
5. Enable and configure only the collection methods which you will use.

    * To **Collect Cyera logs via API**, you'll need to:

        - Configure **URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.
        - Enable/Disable the required datasets.
        - For each dataset, adjust the integration configuration parameters if required, including the Initial Interval, Interval, Batch Size etc. to enable data collection.

6. Select **Save and continue** to save the integration.

### Validation

#### Dashboards populated

1. In Kibana, navigate to **Dashboards**.
2. In the search bar, type **cyera**.
3. Select a dashboard for the dataset you are collecting, and verify the dashboard information is populated.

#### Transforms healthy

1. In Kibana, navigate to **Management** > **Stack Management**.
2. Under **Data**, select **Transforms**.
3. In the search bar, type **cyera**.
4. All transforms from the search results should indicate **Healthy** under the **Health** column.

## Performance and scaling

## Reference

### ECS field reference

### Classification

{{fields "classification"}}

#### Example event

{{event "classification"}}

### Issue

{{fields "issue"}}

#### Example event

{{event "event"}}

### Inputs used

These inputs can be used in this integration:

- [cel](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/beats/filebeat/filebeat-input-cel)

#### ILM Policy

To facilitate classification, issues and event data, source data stream-backed indices `.ds-logs-cyera.<data_stream_name>-*` are allowed to contain duplicates from each polling interval. ILM policy `logs-cyera.<data_stream_name>-default_policy` is added to these source indices, so it doesn't lead to unbounded growth. This means that in these source indices data will be deleted after `30 days` from ingested date.
