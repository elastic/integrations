  description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.'

      description: 'event.created contains the date/time when the event was first read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

        This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain the time extracted from the original event.

        In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event, and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor your agent''s or pipeline''s ability to keep up with your event source.

        In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used.'

        In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` < `event.created` < `event.ingested`.'
