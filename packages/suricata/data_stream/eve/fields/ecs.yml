        This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy.
        `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.
        Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.
        Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer.
        Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.

        The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.
        What the different severity values mean can be different between sources and use cases. It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across events from the same source.
        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`. `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS). If the event source does not publish its own severity, you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.
