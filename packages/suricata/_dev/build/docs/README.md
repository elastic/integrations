# Suricata Integration

This integration is for [Suricata](https://suricata-ids.org/). It reads the EVE
JSON output file. The EVE output writes alerts, anomalies, metadata, file info
and protocol specific records as JSON.

## Compatibility

This module has been developed against Suricata v4.0.4, but is expected to work
with other versions of Suricata.

## EVE

{{event "eve"}}

{{fields "eve"}}
