# GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration collects events from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and Azure Eventhub. It can also retrieve global advisories (reviewed or unreviewed) from the GitHub Security Advisories database. 

## Logs

### Audit

The GitHub audit log records all events related to the GitHub organization/enterprise. See [Organization audit log actions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#audit-log-actions) and [Enterprise audit log actions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/about-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise) for more details.

To use this integration, the following prerequisites must be met:

For GitHub Enterprise Cloud:
  - You must be an enterprise owner.
  - Your enterprise account must be on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan that includes audit log access.

For GitHub Enterprise Server:
  - You need to be a site administrator to access the audit log for the entire instance.
  - The audit log is part of the server deployment. Ensure audit logging is enabled in the server configuration.

For Organizations:
  - You must be an organization owner.
  - You must be using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
  - The organization must be part of an enterprise plan that includes audit log functionality.

Github integration can collect audit logs from 2 sources: [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise) and [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs).

When using Github API to collect audit log events, below requirements must be met for Personal Access Token (PAT):
 - You must use a Personal Access Token with `read:audit_log` scope. This applies to both organization and enterprise admins.
 - If you're an enterprise admin, ensure your token also includes `admin:enterprise` scope to access enterprise-wide logs.

To collect audit log events from Azure Event Hubs, follow the [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs) to setup audit log streaming. For more details, see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise).

*This integration is not compatible with GitHub Enterprise server.*

### Code Scanning

The Code Scanning lets you retrieve all security vulnerabilities and coding errors from a repository setup using GitHub Advanced Security Code Scanning feature. See [About code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) for more details.

To use this integration, GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` read permission. 
Or use a personal access token with the `security_events` scope for private repos or `public_repo` scope for public repos. See [List code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.kind |  | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |  |

### Secret Scanning

The GitHub Secret Scanning lets you retrieve secret scanning for advanced security alerts from a repository setup using GitHub Advanced Security Secret Scanning feature. See [About Secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) for more details.

To use this integration, GitHub Apps must have the `secret_scanning_alerts` read permission. 
Or you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope. For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope. See [List secret scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/secret-scanning#list-secret-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.kind |  | constant_keyword |  |  |

### Dependabot

The GitHub Dependabot lets you retrieve known vulnerabilites in dependencies from a repository setup using GitHub Advanced Security Dependabot feature. See [About Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts) for more details.

To use this integration, you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope. For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope. See [Authenticating with GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql) and [Token Issue](https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/169)

### Issues

The GitHub Issues datastream lets you retrieve github issues, including pull requests, issue assignees, comments, labels, and milestones. See [About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=latest) for more details. You can retrieve issues for specific repository or for entire organization. Since GitHub API considers pull requests as issues, users can use `github.issues.is_pr` field to filter for only pull requests. 

All issues including `closed` are retrieved by default. If users want to retrieve only `open` requests, you need to change `State` parameter to `open`.

To use this integration, users must use GitHub Apps or Personal Access Token with `read` permission to repositories or organization. Please refer to [GitHub Apps Permissions Required](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps?apiVersion=latest) and [Personal Access Token Permissions Required](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=latest) for more details.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.kind |  | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |  |

### Security Advisories

The GitHub Security Advisories datastream lets you retrieve reviewed and unreviewed global security advisories from the GitHub advisory database. See [Working with security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) for more details.

To use this integration, you must [create a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) (GitHub App user access tokens, GitHub App installation access tokens, Fine-grained personal access tokens). This fine-grained token does not require any permissions.

After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed.\n\nWith the affected versions <v2.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users with <v2.0. Nethertheless with XSS, other attack vectors like redirection or crypto mining would be possble.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis CVE has been fixed in v2.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are the only authenticated user using Gokapi, you are not affected. A workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption.",

        "description": "### Impact\n\nWhen using end-to-end encryption, a stored XSS vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed.\n\nWith the affected versions <v2.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users with <v2.0. Nethertheless with XSS, other attack vectors like redirection or crypto mining would be possble.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis CVE has been fixed in v2.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are the only authenticated user using Gokapi, you are not affected. A workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption.",
