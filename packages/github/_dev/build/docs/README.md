# GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration collects events from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest ).

## Logs

### Audit

The GitHub audit log records all events related to the GitHub organization. See [Audit log actions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#audit-log-actions) for more details.

To use this integration, the following prerequisites must be met:
 - You must be an organization owner.
 - You must be using Github Enterprise Cloud.
 - You must use a Personal Access Token with `read:audit_log` scope.

*This integration is not compatible with GitHub Enterprise server.*

### Code Scanning

The Code Scanning lets you retrieve all security vulnerabilities and coding errors from a repository setup using Github Advanced Security Code Scanning feature. See [About code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) for more details.

To use this integration, GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` read permission. 
Or use a personal access token with the `security_events` scope for private repos or `public_repo` scope for public repos. See [List code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)

### Secret Scanning

The Github Secret Scanning lets you retrieve secret scanning for advanced security alerts from a repository setup using Github Advanced Security Secret Scanning feature. See [About Secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) for more details.

To use this integration, GitHub Apps must have the `secret_scanning_alerts` read permission. 
Or you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope. For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope. See [List secret scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/secret-scanning#list-secret-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)

### Dependabot

The Github Dependabot lets you retrieve known vulnerabilites in dependencies from a repository setup using Github Advanced Security Dependabot feature. See [About Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts) for more details.

To use this integration, you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope. For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope. See [Authenticating with GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql) and [Token Issue](https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/169)

### Issues

The Github Issues datastream lets you retrieve github issues, including pull requests, issue assignees, comments, labels, and milestones. See [About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=latest) for more details. You can retrieve issues for specific repository or for entire organization. Since Github API considers pull requests as issues, users can use `github.issues.is_pr` field to filter for only pull requests. 

All issues including `closed` are retrieved by default. If users want to retrieve only `open` requests, you need to change `State` parameter to `open`.

To use this integration, users must use Github Apps or Personal Access Token with `read` permission to repositories or organization. Please refer to [Github Apps Permissions Required](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps?apiVersion=latest) and [Personal Access Token Permissions Required](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=latest) for more details.
