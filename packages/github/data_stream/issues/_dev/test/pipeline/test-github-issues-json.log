While we have several Threat Intel integrations which map STIX formatted data to Elastic Common Schema, users will always have need to ingest IOC's from threat feeds that we don't support out of the box. 'How do I ingest STIX feeds' remains a very common questions across community Slack, Discuss, Github, etc. A custom package would solve for this. \r\n\r\nTo allow for the broad range of STIX formatted feeds, we should provide a way for users to ingest data from ANY STIX feed, via a 'Custom STIX' package. The package will leverage our httpjson input under the hood, but include an ingest pipeline which maps STIX fields to ECS (we expect there'll still be a need for custom fields, as not all STIX fields have a corresponding field in ECS). \r\n\r\nThere may be cases where some feeds/vendors don't strictly conform to STIX, and in those cases, users may have to modify our pipeline and that's ok. We'll focus on correctly formatted STIX data.
