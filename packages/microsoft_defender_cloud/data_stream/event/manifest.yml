          Elastic recommends using one Azure Event Hub for each integration. Visit [Create an Azure Event Hub](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/azure#create-an-event-hub) to learn more. Use Azure Event Hub names up to 30 characters long to avoid compatibility issues.

          The storage account container where the integration stores the checkpoint data for the consumer group. It is an advanced option to use with extreme care. You must use a dedicated storage account container for each Azure log type. Do not reuse the same container name for more than one Azure log type. See [Container Names] (Naming and Referencing Containers, Blobs, and Metadata - Azure Storage) for details on naming rules from Microsoft. The integration generates a default container name if not specified.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
