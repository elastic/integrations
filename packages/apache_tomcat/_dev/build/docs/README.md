# Apache Tomcat Integration

## Overview

[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.1-doc/logging.html) is a free and open-source implementation of the jakarta servlet, jakarta expression language, and websocket technologies. It provides a pure java http web server environment in which java code can also run. Thus, it is a java web application server, although not a full JEE application server.

Use the Apache Tomcat integration to:

- Collect logs related to access.
- Create visualizations to monitor, measure and analyze the usage trend and key data, and derive business insights.
- Create alerts to reduce the MTTD and also the MTTR by referencing relevant logs when troubleshooting an issue.

## Data streams

The Apache Tomcat integration collects logs data.

Logs help you keep a record of events that happen on your machine. The `Log` data stream collected by Apache Tomcat integration is `access`, so that users can keep track of the IP addresses of the clients, bytes returned to the client or sent by clients, etc., so that users could monitor and troubleshoot the performance of Java applications.

Data stream:
- `access`: Collects information related to overall performance of Java applications.

Note:
- Users can monitor and see the log inside the ingested documents for Apache Tomcat in the `logs-*` index pattern from `Discover`.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Apache Tomcat versions `10.1.5`, `9.0.71` and `8.5.85`.

## Prerequisites

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Steps to configure Filestream input for Access logs

Here are the steps to configure Log format in Apache Tomcat instance:

1. Go to `<tomcat_home>/conf/server.xml` from Apache Tomcat instance.

2. The user can update the log format in the pattern field of the class `org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve`. Here is an example of the `org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve` class.

```
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" directory="logs"
       prefix="localhost_access_log" suffix=".txt"
       pattern='%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b %A %X %T "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i" X-Forwarded-For="%{X-Forwarded-For}i"' />
```

3. The supported log formats are:
```
Common Log Format :- '%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b'
Combined Log Format :- '%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{Referrer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"'
Combined Log Format + X-Forwarded-For header :- '%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b %A %X %T "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i" X-Forwarded-For="%{X-Forwarded-For}i"'
```

4. Run the following commands to restart Apache Tomcat instance: -

```
systemctl restart tomcat
```

Note:
- Restarting Apache Tomcat does not affect the virtual desktops that are currently running. It will only prevent new users from logging in for the duration of the restart process (typically several seconds).

## Validation

After the integration is successfully configured, clicking on the Assets tab of the Apache Tomcat Integration should display a list of available dashboards. Click on the dashboard available for your configured data stream. It should be populated with the required data.

## Logs reference

### Access

This is the `Access` data stream. This data stream collects logs related to overall performance of Java applications.

{{event "access"}}

{{fields "access"}}
