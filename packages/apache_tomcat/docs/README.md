# Apache Tomcat Integration

## Overview

[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.1-doc/logging.html) is a free and open-source implementation of the jakarta servlet, jakarta expression language, and websocket technologies. It provides a pure java http web server environment in which java code can also run. Thus, it is a java web application server, although not a full JEE application server.

Use the Apache Tomcat integration to:

- Collect logs related to catalina.
- Create visualizations to monitor, measure and analyze the usage trend and key data, and derive business insights.
- Create alerts to reduce the MTTD and also the MTTR by referencing relevant logs when troubleshooting an issue.

## Data streams

The Apache Tomcat integration collects logs data.

Logs help you keep a record of events that happen on your machine. The `Log` data stream collected by Apache Tomcat integration is `catalina`, so that users could monitor and troubleshoot the performance of Java applications.

Data streams:
- `catalina`: Collects information related to the startup and shutdown of the Apache Tomcat application server, the deployment of new applications, or the failure of one or more subsystems.

Note:
- Users can monitor and see the log inside the ingested documents for Apache Tomcat in the `logs-*` index pattern from `Discover`.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Apache Tomcat versions `10.1.5`, `9.0.71` and `8.5.85`.

## Prerequisites

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Validation

After the integration is successfully configured, clicking on the Assets tab of the Apache Tomcat Integration should display a list of available dashboards. Click on the dashboard available for your configured data stream. It should be populated with the required data.

## Logs reference

### Catalina

This is the `Catalina` data stream. This data stream collects logs related to the startup and shutdown of the Apache Tomcat application server, the deployment of new applications, or the failure of one or more subsystems.

An example event for `catalina` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2023-05-05T11:09:44.042Z",

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| apache_tomcat.catalina.subsystem | Indicates Apache Tomcatâ€™s subsystem or the type of the module that was the source of the message. For example, RBPM or Java Messaging Service (JMS). | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| error.stack_trace | The stack trace of this error in plain text. | wildcard |
| error.stack_trace.text | Multi-field of `error.stack_trace`. | match_only_text |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
