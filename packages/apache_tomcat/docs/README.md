# Tomcat Integration

## Overview

[Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.1-doc/logging.html) is a free and open-source implementation of the jakarta servlet, jakarta expression language, and websocket technologies. It provides a pure java http web server environment in which java code can also run. Thus, it is a java web application server, although not a full JEE application server.

Use the Tomcat integration to:

- Collect metrics related to the cache.
- Create visualizations to monitor, measure and analyze the usage trend and key data, and derive business insights.
- Create alerts to reduce the MTTD and also the MTTR by referencing relevant logs when troubleshooting an issue.

## Data stream

The Tomcat integration collects metrics data.

Metrics give you insight into the statistics of the Tomcat. The Metric data stream collected by the Tomcat integration is `cache`, so that the user can monitor and troubleshoot the performance of the Tomcat instance.

Data stream:
- `cache`: Collects information related to overall cache of the Tomcat instance.

Note:
- Users can monitor and see the metrics inside the ingested documents for Tomcat in the `metrics-*` index pattern from `Discover`.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Tomcat versions `10.1.5`, `9.0.71` and `8.5.85`, and Prometheus version `0.17.2`.

In order to find out the Tomcat version of instance, see following approaches:

1. Go to Tomcat web instance and on top left corner user can see `Apache Tomcat/10.1.5`. Here `10.1.5` is Tomcat version.

2. Go to `<tomcat_home>/bin` in CLI. Please run the following command:

```
sh version.sh
```

## Prerequisites

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

In order to ingest data from the Tomcat, user must have

* Configured Prometheus in Tomcat instance

## Setup
  
For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the [Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Steps to setup Prometheus

Here are the steps to configure Prometheus in Tomcat instance:

1. Go to `<tomcat_home>/webapps` from Tomcat instance.

2. Please find latest [Prometheus version](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/), replace in below command and perform from Tomcat instance: -

```
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/<prometheus_version>/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-<prometheus_version>.jar
```
3. Create `config.yml` file in `<tomcat_home>/webapps` and paste the following content in `config.yml` file: -

```
rules:
- pattern: ".*"
```
4. Go to `/etc/systemd/system` and add the following content in `tomcat.service` file: -

```
Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-javaagent:/opt/tomcat/webapps/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-<prometheus_version>.jar=9409:/opt/tomcat/webapps/config.yaml'
```

5. Run the following commands to reload demon and restart Tomcat instance: -

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart tomcat
```

Note:
- Restarting Tomcat does not affect the virtual desktops that are currently running. It will only prevent new users from logging in for the duration of the restart process (typically several seconds).

## Configuration

You need the following information from your `Tomcat instance` to configure this integration in Elastic:

### Tomcat Hostname

Host Configuration Format: `http[s]://<hostname>:<port>`

Example Host Configuration: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`

## Validation

After the integration is successfully configured, clicking on the Assets tab of the Tomcat Integration should display a list of available dashboards. Click on the dashboard available for your configured data stream. It should be populated with the required data.

## Troubleshooting

- In case of data ingestion if user encounter following errors then it is because of the rate limit of Prometheus endpoint. Here there won't be any data loss but if user still want to avoid it then make sure configured Prometheus endpoint is not being accessed from multiple places.
```
{
  "error": {
    "message": "unable to decode response from prometheus endpoint: error making http request: Get \"http://127.0.0.1/metrics\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1: connect: connection refused"
  }
}
```

## Metrics reference

### Cache

This is the `Cache` data stream. This data stream collects metrics related to the size of the cache and time-to-live for cache entries.

An example event for `cache` looks as following:

```json
