          By default, date times in the logs will be interpreted as UTC timezone. If the timezone of logs is different, use this field to set the timezone offset so that date times are correctly parsed. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00").
