# PHP-FPM Integration

## Overview

PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is a web tool used to speed up the performance of a website. It is much faster than traditional CGI based methods and has the ability to handle tremendous loads simultaneously.

## Data streams

The PHP-FPM integration collects metrics data.

Metrics give you insight into the statistics of the PHP-FPM. Metrics data streams collected by the PHP-FPM integration include [pool](https://www.php.net/manual/en/fpm.status.php#:~:text=Basic%20information%20%2D%20Always%20displayed%20on%20the%20status%20page) and [process](https://www.php.net/manual/en/fpm.status.php#:~:text=Per%2Dprocess%20information%20%2D%20only%20displayed%20in%20full%20output%20mode) so that the user can monitor and troubleshoot the performance of the PHP-FPM instances.

Note:
- Users can monitor and see the metrics inside the ingested documents for PHP-FPM in the logs-* index pattern from `Discover`.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against `v8.2` and `v8.1` standalone versions of PHP-FPM.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it. You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

In order to ingest data from PHP-FPM, you must know the host(s) and status path of the PHP-FPM instance.

Host configuration format: `http[s]://host[:port]`

Example host configuration: `http://localhost:8080`

Status path configuration format: `/path`

Example Status path configuration: `/status` 

## Metrics reference

### Pool

This is the `pool` data stream. `pool` data stream collects metrics related to the setup and contents of the FPM status page.

### Process

This is the `process` data stream. `process` data stream collects metrics like request duration, content length, process state, etc.
