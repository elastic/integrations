# Cloud Security Posture Management 

The Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) integration discovers and evaluates the services in your cloud environment, like storage, compute, IAM, and more, against hardening guidelines defined by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) to help you identify and remediate configurations risks that could potentially undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data in the cloud. 

## Getting started with CSPM

For in-depth, step-by-step guidance to help you get started with CSPM, please read through [our getting started guide](https://ela.st/cspm-get-started). 

## Using CSPM  

After you deploy this integration, the pages described in the table below will begin to get populated with security posture data. Please read the ["Use Cases"](https://ela.st/cspm-use-cases) section of the CSPM documentation for step-by-step instructions on how to use these pages to get insight into and improve your cloud security posture.

| Posture Dashboard | The posture dashboard provides an overview of the security posture of both Cloud accounts and Kubernetes clusters monitored. You can access the posture dashboard via the dashboards section of the security solution. Please read the [posture dashboard documentation](https://ela.st/posture-dashboard) to learn more.                                                |
| Findings          | Findings communicate the configuration risks discovered in your environments. The findings page will always display the most up-to-date configuration risks found. You can access the findings page in the main navigation pane of the security solution. Please read the [findings documentation](https://ela.st/findings) to learn more. |
| Benchmark Rules   | Benchmarks hold the configuration rules that are used to assess your specific environments for secure configuration. You can access benchmark rules in the `Manage` section of the security solution under `CLOUD SECURITY POSTURE.` To learn more, please read the [benchmark rules documentation](https://ela.st/configuration-rules)                                                                                                                                                   |
