# Cloud Security Posture Management 


CSPM will enable you to identify potential configuration risks that could compromise your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the cloud. One example of such a risk is a publicly accessible storage bucket, which unauthorized individuals or malicious actors could potentially access. CSPM helps organizations to identify and address these types of risks continuously. Additionally, CSPM offers a centralized view of security posture, enabling you to manage and maintain a consistent security posture across all environments. CSPM also provides in-depth remediation guidance to help you quickly remediate potential security issues. [Learn more about CSPM in our documentation](https://ela.st/cspm)



## Getting started with CSPM

For in-depth, step-by-step instructions to help you get started with CSPM, please read through [our getting started guide](https://ela.st/cspm-get-started). 

## Using CSPM  

After you deploy this integration, the pages described in the table below will begin to get populated with security posture data. Please read the ["Use Cases"](https://ela.st/cspm-use-cases) section of the CSPM documentation for step-by-step instructions on how to use these pages to get insight into and improve your cloud security posture.

| Posture Dashboard | The posture dashboard provides an overview of the security posture of both Cloud Accounts and Kubernetes clusters monitored. You can access the posture dashboard via the dashboards section of the security solution. Please read the [posture dashboard documentation](https://ela.st/posture-dashboard) to learn more.                                                |
| Findings          | Findings communicate the configuration risks discovered in your environments. The findings page will always display the most up-to-date configuration risks found. You can access the findings page in the main navigation pane of the security solution. Please read the [findings documentation](https://ela.st/findings) to learn more. |
| Benchmark Rules   | Benchmarks hold the configuration rules that are used to assess your specific environments for secure configuration. You can access benchmark rules in the `Manage` section of the security solution under `CLOUD SECURITY POSTURE.` To learn more, please read the [benchmark rules documentation](https://ela.st/configuration-rules)                                                                                                                                                   |
