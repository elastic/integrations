For each instance in your project, get its metadata:\n```\ngcloud compute instances list --format=json | jq -r '.\n| \"vTPM: \\(.[].shieldedInstanceConfig.enableVtpm) IntegrityMonitoring: \\(.[].shieldedInstanceConfig.enableIntegrityMonitoring) Name: \\(.[].name)\"'\n```\n\n5.

Click the `Save` button to modify the instance and then click `START` to restart it.\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\nYou can only enable Shielded VM options on instances that have Shielded VM support.\nFor a list of Shielded VM public images, run the gcloud compute images list command with the following flags:\n\n```\ngcloud compute images list --project gce-uefi-images --no-standard-images\n```\n\n8. Stop the instance:\n```\ngcloud compute instances stop <INSTANCE_NAME>\n```\n9.
