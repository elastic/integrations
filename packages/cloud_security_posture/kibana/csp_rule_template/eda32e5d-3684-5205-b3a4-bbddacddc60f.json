            "description": "AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account and makes those logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies.\nAWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys.\nCloudTrail logs can be configured to leverage server side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys (CMK) to further protect CloudTrail logs.\nIt is recommended that CloudTrail be configured to use SSE-KMS.",
            "rationale": "Configuring CloudTrail to use SSE-KMS provides additional confidentiality controls on log data as a given user must have S3 read permission on the corresponding log bucket and must be granted decrypt permission by the CMK policy.",

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)\n2. In the left navigation pane, choose `Trails` .\n3. Select a Trail\n4. Under the `S3` section, ensure `Encrypt log files` is set to `Yes` and a KMS key ID is specified in the `KSM Key Id` field.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n5. Run the following command:\n```\n aws cloudtrail describe-trails \n```\n6. For each trail listed, SSE-KMS is enabled if the trail has a `KmsKeyId` property defined.",
