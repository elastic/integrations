When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365 day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them.

            "description": "AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a given AWS account.\nThe recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.\nCloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery, so log files are stored durably.\nIn addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3 bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.\nFor a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account, CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group.\nIt is recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs.\n\nNote: The intent of this recommendation is to ensure AWS account activity is being captured, monitored, and appropriately alarmed on.\nCloudWatch Logs is a native way to accomplish this using AWS services but does not preclude the use of an alternate solution.",
