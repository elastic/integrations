Click on `Download Report`\n4. Open of Save the file locally\n5. Locate the `<root account>` under the user column\n6. Review `password_last_used, access_key_1_last_used_date, access_key_2_last_used_date` to determine when the 'root user' was last used.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\nRun the following CLI commands to provide a credential report for determining the last time the 'root user' was used:\n```\naws iam generate-credential-report\n```\n```\naws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d | cut -d, -f1,5,11,16 | grep -B1 '<root_account>'\n```\n\nReview `password_last_used`, `access_key_1_last_used_date`, `access_key_2_last_used_date` to determine when the _root user_ was last used.\n\n**Note:** There are a few conditions under which the use of the 'root' user account is required.\nPlease see the reference links for all of the tasks that require use of the 'root' user.",

Change the 'root' user password.\n2. Deactivate or delete any access keys associate with the 'root' user.\n\n**Remember, anyone who has 'root' user credentials for your AWS account has unrestricted access to and control of all the resources in your account, including billing information.",
