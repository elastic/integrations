Setting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.",

            "rationale": "Auditing helps in forensic analysis.\nIf `log_statement` is not set to the correct value, too many statements may be logged leading to issues in finding the relevant information from the logs, or too few statements may be logged with relevant information missing from the logs.\nSetting log_statement to align with your organization's security and logging policies facilitates later auditing and review of database activities.\nThis recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.",
