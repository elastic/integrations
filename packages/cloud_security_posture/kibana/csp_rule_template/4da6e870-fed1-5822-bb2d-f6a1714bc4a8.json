Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Config console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/).\n2. On the top right of the console select target Region.\n3. If presented with Setup AWS Config - follow remediation procedure:\n4. On the Resource inventory page, Click on edit (the gear icon). The Set Up AWS Config page appears.\n5. Ensure 1 or both check-boxes under \"All Resources\" is checked.\n - Include global resources related to IAM resources - which needs to be enabled in 1 region only\n6. Ensure the correct S3 bucket has been defined.\n7. Ensure the correct SNS topic has been defined.\n8. Repeat steps 2 to 7 for each region.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n9. Run this command to show all AWS Config recorders and their properties:\n```\naws configservice describe-configuration-recorders\n```\n10. Evaluate the output to ensure that there's at least one recorder for which `recordingGroup` object includes `\"allSupported\": true` AND `\"includeGlobalResourceTypes\": true`\n\nNote: There is one more parameter \"ResourceTypes\" in recordingGroup object.\nWe don't need to check the same as whenever we set \"allSupported\": true, AWS enforces resource types to be empty (\"ResourceTypes\":[])\n\nSample Output:\n\n```\n{\n    \"ConfigurationRecorders\": [\n        {\n            \"recordingGroup\": {\n                \"allSupported\": true,\n                \"resourceTypes\": [],\n                \"includeGlobalResourceTypes\": true\n            },\n            \"roleARN\": \"arn:aws:iam::<AWS_Account_ID>:role/service-role/<config-role-name>\",\n            \"name\": \"default\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n11. Run this command to show the status for all AWS Config recorders:\n```\naws configservice describe-configuration-recorder-status\n```\n12. In the output, find recorders with `name` key matching the recorders that met criteria in step 2. Ensure that at least one of them includes `\"recording\": true` and `\"lastStatus\": \"SUCCESS\"`",

Click `Config` \n4. Define which resources you want to record in the selected region\n5. Choose to include global resources (IAM resources)\n6. Specify an S3 bucket in the same account or in another managed AWS account\n7. Create an SNS Topic from the same AWS account or another managed AWS account\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n8. Ensure there is an appropriate S3 bucket, SNS topic, and IAM role per the [AWS Config Service prerequisites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-cli-prereq.html).\n9.
