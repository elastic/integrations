            "description": "AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing key which is key material stored within the KMS which is tied to the key ID of the Customer Created customer master key (CMK).\nIt is the backing key that is used to perform cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption.\nAutomated key rotation currently retains all prior backing keys so that decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently.\nIt is recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled for symmetric keys.\nKey rotation can not be enabled for any asymmetric CMK.",
            "rationale": "Rotating encryption keys helps reduce the potential impact of a compromised key as data encrypted with a new key cannot be accessed with a previous key that may have been exposed.\nKeys should be rotated every year, or upon event that would result in the compromise of that key.",

In the left navigation pane, choose `Customer managed keys`\n3. Select a customer managed CMK where `Key spec = SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`\n4. Underneath the `General configuration` panel open the tab `Key rotation`\n5. Ensure that the checkbox `Automatically rotate this KMS key every year.` is activated\n6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for all customer managed CMKs where \"Key spec = SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT\"\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n7. Run the following command to get a list of all keys and their associated `KeyIds` \n```\n aws kms list-keys\n```\n8. For each key, note the KeyId and run the following command\n```\ndescribe-key --key-id <kms_key_id>\n```\n9. If the response contains \"KeySpec = SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT\" run the following command\n```\n aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id <kms_key_id>\n```\n10. Ensure `KeyRotationEnabled` is set to `true`\n11. Repeat steps 2 - 4 for all remaining CMKs",
