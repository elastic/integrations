When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365 day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them.

            "audit": "Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs are enabled:\n\n**From Console:**\n\n1. Sign into the management console\n2. Select `Services` then `VPC` \n3. In the left navigation pane, select `Your VPCs` \n4. Select a VPC\n5. In the right pane, select the `Flow Logs` tab.\n6. Ensure a Log Flow exists that has `Active` in the `Status` column.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n7. Run `describe-vpcs` command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to list the VPC networks available in the current AWS region:\n```\naws ec2 describe-vpcs --region <region> --query Vpcs[].VpcId\n```\n8. The command output returns the `VpcId` available in the selected region.\n9. Run `describe-flow-logs` command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) using the VPC ID to determine if the selected virtual network has the Flow Logs feature enabled:\n```\naws ec2 describe-flow-logs --filter \"Name=resource-id,Values=<vpc-id>\"\n```\n10. If there are no Flow Logs created for the selected VPC, the command output will return an `empty list []`.\n11. Repeat step 3 for other VPCs available in the same region.\n12. Change the region by updating `--region` and repeat steps 1 - 5 for all the VPCs.",

In the left navigation pane, select `Your VPCs` \n4. Select a VPC\n5. In the right pane, select the `Flow Logs` tab.\n6. If no Flow Log exists, click `Create Flow Log` \n7. For Filter, select `Reject`\n8. Enter in a `Role` and `Destination Log Group` \n9. Click `Create Log Flow` \n10. Click on `CloudWatch Logs Group` \n\n**Note:** Setting the filter to \"Reject\" will dramatically reduce the logging data accumulation for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach detection, research and remediation.\nHowever, during periods of least privilege security group engineering, setting this the filter to \"All\" can be very helpful in discovering existing traffic flows required for proper operation of an already running environment.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n11. Create a policy document and name it as `role_policy_document.json` and paste the following content:\n```\n{\n \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n \"Statement\": [\n {\n \"Sid\": \"test\",\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Principal\": {\n \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\"\n },\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n12.

Run the below command to create an IAM role:\n```\naws iam create-role --role-name <aws_support_iam_role> --assume-role-policy-document file://<file-path>role_policy_document.json \n```\n14. Run the below command to create an IAM policy:\n```\naws iam create-policy --policy-name <ami-policy-name> --policy-document file://<file-path>iam-policy.json\n```\n15. Run `attach-group-policy` command using the IAM policy ARN returned at the previous step to attach the policy to the IAM role (if the command succeeds, no output is returned):\n```\naws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:policy/<iam-policy-name> --group-name <group-name>\n```\n16. Run `describe-vpcs` to get the VpcId available in the selected region:\n```\naws ec2 describe-vpcs --region <region>\n```\n17. The command output should return the VPC Id available in the selected region.\n18. Run `create-flow-logs` to create a flow log for the vpc:\n```\naws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type VPC --resource-ids <vpc-id> --traffic-type REJECT --log-group-name <log-group-name> --deliver-logs-permission-arn <iam-role-arn>\n```\n19.
