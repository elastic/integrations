List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:\n\n```\ngcloud sql instances list\n```\n\n4. For every instance of type `instanceType: CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE` with `backendType: SECOND_GEN`, get detailed configuration. Ignore instances of type `READ_REPLICA_INSTANCE` because these instances inherit their settings from the primary instance. Also, note that first generation instances cannot be configured to have a private IP address.\n\n```\ngcloud sql instances describe <INSTANCE_NAME>\n```\n\n5. Ensure that the setting `ipAddresses` has an IP address configured of `type: PRIVATE` and has no IP address of `type: PRIMARY`. `PRIMARY` IP addresses are public addresses. An instance can have both a private and public address at the same time. Note also that you cannot use private IP with First Generation instances.",
