For each bucket, verify that uniform bucket-level access is enabled.\n```\ngsutil uniformbucketlevelaccess get gs://BUCKET_NAME/\n```\nIf uniform bucket-level access is enabled, the response looks like:\n\n```\nUniform bucket-level access setting for gs://BUCKET_NAME/:\n Enabled: True\n LockedTime: LOCK_DATE\n```",
