            "rationale": "A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end-user.\nApplication/VM-Instance uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved.\nIn addition to being an identity, a service account is a resource that has IAM policies attached to it.\nThese policies determine who can use the service account.\n\nUsers with IAM roles to update the App Engine and Compute Engine instances (such as App Engine Deployer or Compute Instance Admin) can effectively run code as the service accounts used to run these instances, and indirectly gain access to all the resources for which the service accounts have access.\nSimilarly, SSH access to a Compute Engine instance may also provide the ability to execute code as that instance/Service account.\n\nBased on business needs, there could be multiple user-managed service accounts configured for a project.\nGranting the `iam.serviceAccountUser` or `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` roles to a user for a project gives the user access to all service accounts in the project, including service accounts that may be created in the future.\nThis can result in elevation of privileges by using service accounts and corresponding `Compute Engine instances`.\n\nIn order to implement `least privileges` best practices, IAM users should not be assigned the `Service Account User` or `Service Account Token Creator` roles at the project level.\nInstead, these roles should be assigned to a user for a specific service account, giving that user access to the service account.\nThe `Service Account User` allows a user to bind a service account to a long-running job service, whereas the `Service Account Token Creator` role allows a user to directly impersonate (or assert) the identity of a service account.",
