            "description": "GCP `Firewall Rules` are specific to a `VPC Network`.\nEach rule either `allows` or `denies` traffic when its conditions are met.\nIts conditions allow the user to specify the type of traffic, such as ports and protocols, and the source or destination of the traffic, including IP addresses, subnets, and instances.\n\nFirewall rules are defined at the VPC network level and are specific to the network in which they are defined.\nThe rules themselves cannot be shared among networks.\nFirewall rules only support IPv4 traffic.\nWhen specifying a source for an ingress rule or a destination for an egress rule by address, only an `IPv4` address or `IPv4 block in CIDR` notation can be used.\nGeneric `(0.0.0.0/0)` incoming traffic from the internet to VPC or VM instance using `SSH` on `Port 22` can be avoided.",
            "rationale": "GCP `Firewall Rules` within a `VPC Network` apply to outgoing (egress) traffic from instances and incoming (ingress) traffic to instances in the network.\nEgress and ingress traffic flows are controlled even if the traffic stays within the network (for example, instance-to-instance communication).\nFor an instance to have outgoing Internet access, the network must have a valid Internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP is specified.\nThis route simply defines the path to the Internet, to avoid the most general `(0.0.0.0/0)` destination `IP Range` specified from the Internet through `SSH` with the default `Port 22`.\nGeneric access from the Internet to a specific IP Range needs to be restricted.",
