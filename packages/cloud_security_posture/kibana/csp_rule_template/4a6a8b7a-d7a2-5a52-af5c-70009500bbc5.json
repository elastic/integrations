Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).\n\n2. For every VM, ensure that there is no `External IP` configured.\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\n```\ngcloud compute instances list --format=json\n```\n\n3. The output should not contain an `accessConfigs` section under `networkInterfaces`. Note that the `natIP` value is present only for instances that are running or for instances that are stopped but have a static IP address. For instances that are stopped and are configured to have an ephemeral public IP address, the `natIP` field will not be present. Example output:\n\n```\nnetworkInterfaces:\n- accessConfigs:\n - kind: compute#accessConfig\n name: External NAT\n networkTier: STANDARD\n type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT\n```\n\n**Exception:**\nInstances created by GKE should be excluded because some of them have external IP addresses and cannot be changed by editing the instance settings.\nInstances created by GKE should be excluded.\nThese instances have names that start with \"gke-\" and are labeled \"goog-gke-node\".",

Delete the access config. \n```\ngcloud compute instances delete-access-config <INSTANCE_NAME> --zone=<ZONE> --access-config-name <ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME>\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME` is `External NAT`.\nThe name of your access config might be different.\n\n**Prevention:**\nYou can configure the `Define allowed external IPs for VM instances` Organization Policy to prevent VMs from being configured with public IP addresses.\nLearn more at: [https://console.cloud.google.com/orgpolicies/compute-vmExternalIpAccess](https://console.cloud.google.com/orgpolicies/compute-vmExternalIpAccess)",
