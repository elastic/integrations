            "description": "Azure App Service Authentication is a feature that can prevent anonymous HTTP requests from reaching a Web Application or authenticate those with tokens before they reach the app.\nIf an anonymous request is received from a browser, App Service will redirect to a logon page.\nTo handle the logon process, a choice from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom authentication mechanism can be implemented.",
            "rationale": "By Enabling App Service Authentication, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by the application code.\nIt also handles authentication of users with the specified provider (Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter), validation, storing and refreshing of tokens, managing the authenticated sessions and injecting identity information into request headers.",

Under `Setting` section, Click on `Authentication`\n5. Ensure that `App Service authentication` set to `Enabled` (Will only appear once an Identity provider is set up/selected)\n\n**From Azure CLI**\n\nTo check App Service Authentication status for an existing app, run the following command,\n\n```\naz webapp auth show --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --query enabled\n```\n\nThe output should return `true` if App Service authentication is set to `On`.",
