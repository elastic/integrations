            "rationale": "A container running with the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to `true` may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent.\n\nThere should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to allow privilege escalation.\nThe option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run.\n\n\nIf you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.",
