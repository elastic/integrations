Go to `Logging/Logs-based Metrics` by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).\n\n2. In the `User-defined Metrics` section, ensure at least one metric `<Log_Metric_Name>` is present with this filter text:\n\n```\nresource.type=\"gce_firewall_rule\" \nAND (protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.patch\" \nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.insert\"\nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.delete\")\n```\n\n**Ensure that the prescribed alerting policy is present:**\n\n3. Go to `Alerting` by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting).\n\n4. Under the `Policies` section, ensure that at least one alert policy exists for the log metric above. Clicking on the policy should show that it is configured with a condition. For example, `Violates when: Any logging.googleapis.com/user/<Log Metric Name> stream` `is above a threshold of zero(0) for greater than zero(0) seconds` means that the alert will trigger for any new owner change. Verify that the chosen alerting thresholds make sense for the user's organization.\n\n5. Ensure that appropriate notification channels have been set up.\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\n**Ensure that the prescribed log metric is present:**\n\n6. List the log metrics:\n```\ngcloud logging metrics list --format json\n```\n7. Ensure that the output contains at least one metric with the filter set to: \n\n```\nresource.type=\"gce_firewall_rule\" \nAND (protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.patch\" \nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.insert\"\nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.delete\")\n```\n\n8. Note the value of the property `metricDescriptor.type` for the identified metric, in the format `logging.googleapis.com/user/<Log Metric Name>`.\n\n**Ensure that the prescribed alerting policy is present:**\n\n9. List the alerting policies:\n```\ngcloud alpha monitoring policies list --format json\n```\n10.

Go to `Logging/Logs-based Metrics` by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics) and click \"CREATE METRIC\".\n\n2. Click the down arrow symbol on the `Filter Bar` at the rightmost corner and select `Convert to Advanced Filter`.\n\n3.

Click `Submit Filter`. Display logs appear based on the filter text entered by the user.\n\n5. In the `Metric Editor` menu on the right, fill out the name field. Set `Units` to `1` (default) and `Type` to `Counter`. This ensures that the log metric counts the number of log entries matching the advanced logs query.\n\n6. Click `Create Metric`. \n\n**Create the prescribed Alert Policy:** \n\n7. Identify the newly created metric under the section `User-defined Metrics` at [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).\n\n8. Click the 3-dot icon in the rightmost column for the new metric and select `Create alert from Metric`. A new page displays.\n\n9. Fill out the alert policy configuration and click `Save`. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the user's organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:\n```\nSet `Aggregator` to `Count`\n\nSet `Configuration`:\n\n- Condition: above\n\n- Threshold: 0\n\n- For: most recent value\n```\n\n10. Configure the desired notifications channels in the section `Notifications`.\n\n11. Name the policy and click `Save`.\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\nCreate the prescribed Log Metric\n- Use the command: gcloud logging metrics create \n\nCreate the prescribed alert policy: \n- Use the command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create",
