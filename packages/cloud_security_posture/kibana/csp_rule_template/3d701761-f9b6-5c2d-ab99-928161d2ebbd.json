Login to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home\n2. In the left pane, click `Network ACLs`\n3. For each network ACL, perform the following:\n - Select the network ACL\n - Click the `Inbound Rules` tab\n - Ensure no rule exists that has a port range that includes port `22`, `3389`, or other remote server administration ports for your environment and has a `Source` of `0.0.0.0/0` and shows `ALLOW`\n\n**Note:** A Port value of `ALL` or a port range such as `0-1024` are inclusive of port `22`, `3389`, and other remote server administration ports",
