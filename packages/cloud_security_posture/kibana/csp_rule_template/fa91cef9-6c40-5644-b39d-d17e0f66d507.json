            "rationale": "Kubernetes can store secrets that pods can access via a mounted volume.\nToday,\nKubernetes secrets are stored with Base64 encoding, but encrypting is the recommended\napproach. Amazon EKS clusters version 1.13 and higher support the capability of\nencrypting your Kubernetes secrets using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer\nManaged Keys (CMK). The only requirement is to enable the encryption provider support\nduring EKS cluster creation.\nUse AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to provide envelope encryption of\nKubernetes secrets stored in Amazon EKS. Implementing envelope encryption is\nconsidered a security best practice for applications that store sensitive data and is part of a\ndefense in depth security strategy.\nApplication-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive\ndata, such as user defined Secrets and Secrets required for the operation of the cluster,\nsuch as service account keys, which are all stored in etcd.\nUsing this functionality, you can use a key, that you manage in AWS KMS, to encrypt data at\nthe application layer. This protects against attackers in the event that they manage to gain\naccess to etcd.\n",
