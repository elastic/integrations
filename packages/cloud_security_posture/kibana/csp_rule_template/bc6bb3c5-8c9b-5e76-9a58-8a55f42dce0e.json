            "description": "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles.\nIt is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant _least privilege_ -that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task.\nDetermine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform _only_ those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative privileges.",
            "rationale": "It's more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.\n\nProviding full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum set of permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to potentially unwanted actions.\n\nIAM policies that have a statement with \"Effect\": \"Allow\" with \"Action\": \"\\*\" over \"Resource\": \"\\*\" should be removed.",
            "audit": "Perform the following to determine what policies are created:\n\n**From Command Line:**\n\n1. Run the following to get a list of IAM policies:\n```\n aws iam list-policies --only-attached --output text\n```\n2. For each policy returned, run the following command to determine if any policies is allowing full administrative privileges on the account:\n```\n aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <policy_arn> --version-id <version>\n```\n3. In output ensure policy should not have any Statement block with `\"Effect\": \"Allow\"` and `Action` set to `\"*\"` and `Resource` set to `\"*\"`",
