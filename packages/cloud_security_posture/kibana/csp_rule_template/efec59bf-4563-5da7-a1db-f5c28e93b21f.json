            "rationale": "There could be scenarios where users accidentally run delete/purge commands on Key Vault or an attacker/malicious user deliberately does so in order to cause disruption.\nDeleting or purging a Key Vault leads to immediate data loss, as keys encrypting data and secrets/certificates allowing access/services will become non-accessible.\nThere are 2 Key Vault properties that play a role in permanent unavailability of a Key Vault:\n\n1. `enableSoftDelete`: \n\nSetting this parameter to \"true\" for a Key Vault ensures that even if Key Vault is deleted, Key Vault itself or its objects remain recoverable for the next 90 days.\nKey Vault/objects can either be recovered or purged (permanent deletion) during those 90 days.\nIf no action is taken, key vault and its objects will subsequently be purged.\n\n2. `enablePurgeProtection`: \n\nenableSoftDelete only ensures that Key Vault is not deleted permanently and will be recoverable for 90 days from date of deletion.\nHowever, there are scenarios in which the Key Vault and/or its objects are accidentally purged and hence will not be recoverable.\nSetting enablePurgeProtection to \"true\" ensures that the Key Vault and its objects cannot be purged.\n\nEnabling both the parameters on Key Vaults ensures that Key Vaults and their objects cannot be deleted/purged permanently.",
