            "description": "IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies.\nThere are three ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy.\n\n\nOnly the third implementation is recommended.",

Run the following to get a list of IAM users:\n```\n aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text \n```\n2. For each user returned, run the following command to determine if any policies are attached to them:\n```\n aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <iam_user>\n aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <iam_user> \n```\n3. If any policies are returned, the user has an inline policy or direct policy attachment.",
