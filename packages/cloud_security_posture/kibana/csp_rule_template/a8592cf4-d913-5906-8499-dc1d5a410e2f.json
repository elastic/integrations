Open the Amazon ECR console at\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.\n2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.\n3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.\n4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.\n5. On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.\n",

Amazon ECR supports package vulnerability scanning for\nmajor versions of Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Oracle Linux,\nAlpine, and RHEL Linux distributions. Amazon ECR does not support scanning images built\nfrom the Docker scratch image.\nAn UNDEFINED severity level is returned You may receive a scan finding that has a severity\nlevel of UNDEFINED. The following are the common causes for this:\nThe vulnerability was not assigned a priority by the CVE source.\nThe vulnerability was assigned a priority that Amazon ECR did not recognize.\nTo determine the severity and description of a vulnerability, you can view the CVE directly\nfrom the source.\n",
