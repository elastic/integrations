# Hadoop

This integration is used to collect [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) metrics as follows:

   - Application Metrics
   - Cluster Metrics
   - DataNode Metrics
   - NameNode Metrics
   - NodeManager Metrics   

This integration uses Resource Manager API and JMX API to collect above metrics.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested against Hadoop version `3.3.6`.

### Troubleshooting

If host.ip is shown conflicted under ``logs-*`` data view, then this issue can be solved by [reindexing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/use-a-data-stream.html#reindex-with-a-data-stream) the ``Application`` data stream's indices.
If host.ip is shown conflicted under ``metrics-*`` data view, then this issue can be solved by [reindexing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tsds-reindex.html) the ``Cluster``, ``Datanode``, ``Namenode`` and ``Node Manager`` data stream's indices.
