# Snyk Integration

<!--
Keep the API docs version in sync with the version used in the agent
configuration in cel.yml.hbs for both REST API data streams.

This is hard-coded in to the state construction instead of being configurable,
since new versions may break our ingest pipeline.
-->
This integration is for ingesting data from the [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) API. The integration allows collection of audit logging information and vulnerability issues via the Snyk [REST API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-04-29#overview).

## Elastic Managed enabled integration

Elastic Managed integrations are only supported on Elastic Cloud Serverless and Elastic Cloud Hosted deployments. An Elastic Managed integration lets you ingest data from a cloud source while avoiding the orchestration, management, and maintenance associated with standard ingest infrastructure. Elastic runs the collector for you, so you can focus on your data instead of the infrastructure that collects it.

For more information, refer to [Elastic Managed integrations](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations) and the [Elastic Managed integrations FAQ](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/ingest/managed-integrations/managed-integrations-faq).

## REST API

- `issues`: Collects all found issues for the related organizations and projects.
- `audit_logs`: Collects audit logging from Snyk, this can be actions like users, permissions, groups, api access and more.

To configure access to the Snyk REST Audit Log API you will have to obtain an API access token from [your Snyk account dashboard](https://app.snyk.io/account) as described in the [Snyk Documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/authentication-for-api).
