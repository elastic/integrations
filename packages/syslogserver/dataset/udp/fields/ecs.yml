- name: '@timestamp'
  level: core
  required: true
  type: date
  description: |-
    Date/time when the event originated.
    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source.
    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.
    Required field for all events.
- name: message
  level: core
  type: text
  description: |-
    For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer.
    For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event.
    If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.
- name: host
  title: Host
  group: 2
  type: group
  fields:
  - name: hostname
    level: core
    type: keyword
    description: |-
      Hostname of the host.
      It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

  short: Fields breaking down the event details.
  description: >
    The event fields are used for context information about the log event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
    Log events must include the time at which the thing happened.
    Examples of log events include a process starting on a host,
    a network packet being sent from a source to a destination,
    or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: severity
      type: long
      level: core
      format: string
      example: 7
      short: Numeric severity of the event.
      description: >
        The numeric severity of the event according to your event source.

        What the different severity values mean can be different between sources
        and use cases.
        It's up to the implementer to make sure severities are consistent across
        events from the same source.

        The Syslog severity belongs in `log.syslog.severity.code`.
        `event.severity` is meant to represent the severity according to
        the event source (e.g. firewall, IDS).
        If the event source does not publish its own severity,
        you may optionally copy the `log.syslog.severity.code` to `event.severity`.
    - name: sequence
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Sequence number of the event.
      description: >
        Sequence number of the event.

        The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the
        exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision.
- name: log
  title: Log
  group: 2
  short: Details about the event's logging mechanism.
  description: >
    Details about the event's logging mechanism or logging transport.

    The log.* fields are typically populated with details about the logging
    mechanism used to create and/or transport the event.
    For example, syslog details belong under `log.syslog.*`.

    The details specific to your event source are typically not logged under `log.*`,
    but rather in `event.*` or in other ECS fields.
  type: group
  fields:
    - name: syslog.priority
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 135
      short: Syslog priority of the event.
      description: >
        Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available.

        According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 * facility + severity.
        This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191.
    - name: syslog.facility.code
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 23
      short: Syslog numeric facility of the event.
      description: >
        The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available.

        According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23.
    - name: syslog.facility.name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: local7
      short: Syslog text-based facility of the event.
      description: >
        The Syslog text-based facility of the log event, if available.
- name: source
  title: Source
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the source side of a network connection, used with destination.
  description: >
    Source fields describe details about the source of a packet/event.

    Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Source network address.
      description: >
        Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.
- name: process
  title: Process

  type: group
  fields:

  - name: name
    level: extended

      Sometimes called program name or similar.
