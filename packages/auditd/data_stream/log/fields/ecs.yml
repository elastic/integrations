      `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure
      from the perspective of the entity that produced the event.

      Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event
      may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective.

      Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains
      multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that
      best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event
      producer.

      Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example,
      this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`,
      or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense.'
