# Palo Alto Cortex XDR Integration

The PANW XDR integration collects events from the Cortex XDR API, specifically reading from the Alert API.

## Logs

### Alerts

The Cortex XDR Alerts API is used to retrieve alerts generated by Cortex XDR based on raw endpoint data. A single alert might include one or more local endpoint events, each event generating its own document on Elasticsearch.

The Palo Alto XDR integration requires both an API key and API key ID, both which can be retrieved from the Cortex XDR UI:
