# Palo Alto Cortex XDR Integration

The PANW XDR integration collects alerts with multiple events from the [Cortex XDR Alerts API](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR-REST-API/Get-all-Alerts) and incidents from [Cortex XDR Incidents API](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR-REST-API/IncidentManagement).

## Logs

### Alerts

The Cortex XDR Alerts API is used to retrieve alerts generated by Cortex XDR based on raw endpoint data. A single alert might include one or more local endpoint events, each event generating its own document on Elasticsearch.

The Palo Alto XDR integration requires both an API key and API key ID, both which can be retrieved from the Cortex XDR UI. See: [Get Started with Cortex XDR API](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr/cortex-xdr-api/cortex-xdr-api-overview/get-started-with-cortex-xdr-apis.html)
