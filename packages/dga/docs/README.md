# Domain Generation Algorithm Detection

The Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection package contains assets to detect DGA activity in your network data. This package requires a Platinum subscription. Please ensure that you have a Trial or Platinum level subscription installed on your cluster before proceeding. This package is licensed under [Elastic License 2.0](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license).

## Installation

1. **Upgrading**: If upgrading from a version below v2.0.0, see the section v2.0.0 and beyond.
1. **Add the Integration Package**: Install the package via **Management > Integrations > Add Domain Generation Algorithm Detection**. Configure the integration name and agent policy. Click Save and Continue. (Note that this integration does not rely on an agent, and can be assigned to a policy without an agent.)
1. **Install assets**: Install the assets by clicking **Settings > Install Domain Generation Algorithm Detection assets**.
1. **Configure the pipeline**: To configure the pipeline you can use one of the following steps:
    - If using Elastic Defend, add a custom pipeline to the data stream. Go to **Stack Management > Ingest Pipelines**, and check if the pipeline `logs-endpoint.events.network@custom` exists. 
    ![Component Templates](../img/custom-pipeline.png)
    If it does not exist, you can create it by running the following command in the Dev Console. Be sure to replace `<VERSION>` with the current package version.
      ```
      PUT _ingest/pipeline/logs-endpoint.events.network@custom
      {
        "processors": [
          {
            "pipeline": {
              "name": "<VERSION>-ml_dga_ingest_pipeline",
              "ignore_missing_pipeline": true,
              "ignore_failure": true
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    - If `logs-endpoint.events.process@custom` already exists, select the three dots next to it and choose **Edit**. Click **Add a processor**. Select **Pipeline** for Processor, enter `<VERSION>-ml_dga_ingest_pipeline` for name (replacing `<VERSION>` with the current package version), and check **Ignore missing pipeline** and **Ignore failures for this processor**. Select **Add Processor**.
    - If using an Elastic Beat such as Packetbeat, add the ingest pipeline to it by adding a simple configuration [setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html#pipelines-for-beats) to `packetbeat.yml` and skip to the **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs** section in these instructions.
1. **Add the required mappings to the index or component template**: Go to **Stack Management > Index Management > Component Templates**. Templates that can be edited to add custom components will be marked with a `@custom` suffix. For instance, the custom component template for Elastic Defend network events is `logs-endpoint.events.network@custom`. **Note:** Do not attempt to edit the `@package` template.
    ![Component Templates](../img/component-templates.png)
    - If the `@custom` component template does not exist, you can execute the following command in the Dev Console to create it and then continue to the **Rollover** section in these instructions.
      ```
      PUT _component_template/{COMPONENT_TEMPLATE_NAME}@custom
      {
        "template": {
          "mappings": {
            "properties": {
              "ml_is_dga": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "malicious_prediction": {
                    "type": "long"
                  },
                  "malicious_probability": {
                    "type": "float"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    - If the `@custom` component template already exists, you will need to edit it to add mappings for data to be properly enriched. Click the three dots next to it and select **Edit**. 
    ![Component Templates](../img/component-templates-edit.png)
    - On the index settings step, add the following. Be sure to change `<VERSION>` to the current package version.
      ```
      {
        "index": {
          "default_pipeline": "<VERSION>-ml_dga_ingest_pipeline"
        }
      }
      ```
    - Proceed to the mappings step in the UI. Click **Add Field** at the bottom of the page and create an an `Object` field for `ml_is_dga`. 
    ![Component Templates](../img/field1.png)
    - Finally create two properties under `ml_is_dga`.
    ![Component Templates](../img/field1a.png)
    - The first for `malicious_prediction` of type `Long` and then for `malicious_probability` or type `Float`.
    ![Component Templates](../img/field2.png)
    - Your component mappings should look like the following:
    ![Component Templates](../img/fields-complete.png)
    - Click **Review** then **Save Component Template**.
1. **Rollover** Depending on your environment, you may need to [rollover](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-rollover-index.html) in order for these mappings to get picked up. The deault index pattern for Elastic Defend is `logs-endpoint.events.network-default`.
    ```
    POST INDEX_NAME/_rollover
    ```
1. **(Optional) [Create a data view](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/data-views.html)** for your network logs.
1. **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**: In **Machine Learning > Anomaly Detection**, when you create a job, you should see an option to `Use preconfigured jobs` with a card for `DGA`. When you select the card, you will see a pre-configured anomaly detection job that you can enable depending on what makes the most sense for your environment. Note this job is only useful for indices that have been enriched by the ingest pipeline.
1. **Enable detection rules**: You can also enable detection rules to alert on DGA activity in your environment, based on anomalies flagged by the above ML jobs. As of version 2.0.0 of this package, these rules are available as part of the Detection Engine in **Security > Rules**, and can be found using the tag `Use Case: Domain Generated Algorithm Detection`. See this [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-rules-management.html#load-prebuilt-rules) for more information on importing and enabling the rules.

*In **Security > Rules**, filtering with the “Use Case: Domain Generation Algorithm Detection” tag*

## Anomaly Detection Jobs

| Job | Description |
|---|---|
| dga_high_sum_probability | Detects potential DGA (domain generation algorithm) activity that is often used by malware command and control (C2) channels. Looks for a source IP address making DNS requests that have an aggregate high probability of being DGA activity.| 

## v2.0.0 and beyond

v2.0.0 of the package introduces breaking changes, namely deprecating detection rules from the package. To continue receiving updates to DGA Detection, we recommend upgrading to v2.0.0 after doing the following:
- Uninstall existing rules associated with this package: Navigate to **Security > Rules** and delete the following rules:
    - Machine Learning Detected DGA activity using a known SUNBURST DNS domain
    - Machine Learning Detected a DNS Request Predicted to be a DGA Domain
    - Potential DGA Activity
    - Machine Learning Detected a DNS Request With a High DGA Probability Score

Depending on the version of the package you're using, you might also be able to search for the above rules using the tag `DGA`
- Upgrade the DGA package to v2.0.0 using the steps [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/upgrade-integration.html)
- Install the new rules as described in the [Enable detection rules](#enable-detection-rules) section below

In version 2.0.1 and after, the package ignores data in cold and frozen data tiers to reduce heap memory usage, avoid running on outdated data, and to follow best practices.

## Licensing

Usage in production requires that you have a license key that permits use of machine learning features.
