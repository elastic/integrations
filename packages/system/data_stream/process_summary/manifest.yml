          When running in unprivileged mode, the `process` and
          `process_summary` metricsets might emit incomplete metrics
          because some metrics require elevated privileges and may be
          missing as a result.

          To help identify potential permission-related issues, you can
          enable this configuration option. If providing the necessary
          access is not possible, disabling this option will ensure that
          the metricsets remain healthy and functional.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
