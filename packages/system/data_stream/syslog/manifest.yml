          A list of filter expressions used to select the logs to read (e.g. `_SYSTEMD_UNIT=vault.service`). Defaults to all logs. See
          [include_matches](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-journald.html#filebeat-input-journald-include-matches) for details.
          The logs are already filtered by the following syslog facilities: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, so any filter added here will be added to this existing
          filter.
