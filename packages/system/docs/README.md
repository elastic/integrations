# System Integration

The System integration allows you to monitor servers, personal computers, and more.

Use the System integration to collect metrics and logs from your machines.
Then visualize that data in Kibana, create alerts to notify you if something goes wrong,
and reference data when troubleshooting an issue.

For example, if you wanted to be notified when less than 10% of the disk space is still available, you
could install the System integration to send file system metrics to Elastic.
Then, you could view real-time updates to disk space used on your system in Kibana's _[Metrics System] Overview_ dashboard.
You could also set up a new rule in the Elastic Observability Metrics app to alert you when the percent free is
less than 10% of the total disk space.

## Data streams

The System integration collects two types of data: logs and metrics.

**Logs** help you keep a record of events that happen on your machine.
Log data streams collected by the System integration include application, system, and security events on
machines running Windows and auth and syslog events on machines running macOS or Linux.
See more details in the [Logs reference](#logs-reference).

**Metrics** give you insight into the state of the machine.
Metric data streams collected by the System integration include CPU usage, load statistics, memory usage,
information on network behavior, and more.
See more details in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

You can enable and disable individual data streams. If _all_ data streams are disabled and the System integration
is still enabled, Fleet uses the default data streams.

## Requirements

You need Elasticsearch for storing and searching your data and Kibana for visualizing and managing it.
You can use our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud, which is recommended, or self-manage the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

Each data stream collects different kinds of metric data, which may require dedicated permissions
to be fetched and which may vary across operating systems.
Details on the permissions needed for each data stream are available in the [Metrics reference](#metrics-reference).

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the
[Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Troubleshooting

Note that certain data streams may access `/proc` to gather process information,
and the resulting `ptrace_may_access()` call by the kernel to check for
permissions can be blocked by
[AppArmor and other LSM software](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/TechnicalDoc_Proc_and_ptrace), even though the System module doesn't use `ptrace` directly.

In addition, when running inside a container the proc filesystem directory of the host
should be set using `system.hostfs` setting to `/hostfs`.

### Windows Event ID clause limit

If you specify more than 22 query conditions (event IDs or event ID ranges), some
versions of Windows will prevent the integration from reading the event log due to
limits in the query system. If this occurs, a similar warning as shown below:

```
The specified query is invalid.
```

In some cases, the limit may be lower than 22 conditions. For instance, using a
mixture of ranges and single event IDs, along with an additional parameter such
as `ignore older`, results in a limit of 21 conditions.

If you have more than 22 conditions, you can work around this Windows limitation
by using a drop_event processor to do the filtering after filebeat has received
the events from Windows. The filter shown below is equivalent to
`event_id: 903, 1024, 2000-2004, 4624` but can be expanded beyond 22 event IDs.

```yaml
- drop_event.when.not.or:
  - equals.winlog.event_id: "903"
  - equals.winlog.event_id: "1024"
  - equals.winlog.event_id: "4624"
  - range:
      winlog.event_id.gte: 2000
      winlog.event_id.lte: 2004
```

### Application

The Windows `application` data stream provides events from the Windows
`Application` event log.

#### Supported operating systems

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| winlog.activity_id | A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The events that are published with this identifier are part of the same activity. | keyword |
| winlog.api | The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the Event Logging API. The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically detects which API to use for reading event logs. | keyword |
| winlog.channel | The name of the channel from which this record was read. This value is one of the names from the `event_logs` collection in the configuration. | keyword |
| winlog.computer_name | The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows event forwarding, this name can differ from `agent.hostname`. | keyword |
| winlog.event_data | The event-specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with `user_data`. If you are capturing event data on versions prior to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`, `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in earlier versions of Windows. | object |

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | keyword |
| process.executable.caseless | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | keyword |
| process.executable.text | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | match_only_text |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.name.caseless | Multi-field of `process.name`. | keyword |
| process.name.text | Multi-field of `process.name`. | match_only_text |
| winlog.activity_id | A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The events that are published with this identifier are part of the same activity. | keyword |
| winlog.api | The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the Event Logging API. The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically detects which API to use for reading event logs. | keyword |
| winlog.channel | The name of the channel from which this record was read. This value is one of the names from the `event_logs` collection in the configuration. | keyword |
| winlog.computerObject.domain |  | keyword |
| winlog.computerObject.id |  | keyword |
| winlog.computerObject.name |  | keyword |
| winlog.computer_name | The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows event forwarding, this name can differ from `agent.hostname`. | keyword |
| winlog.event_data | The event-specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with `user_data`. If you are capturing event data on versions prior to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`, `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in earlier versions of Windows. | object |

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| input.type | Input type | keyword |
| log.offset | Log offset | long |
| system.auth.ssh.dropped_ip | The client IP from SSH connections that are open and immediately dropped. | ip |
| system.auth.ssh.event | The SSH event as found in the logs (Accepted, Invalid, Failed, etc.) | keyword |
| system.auth.ssh.method | The SSH authentication method. Can be one of "password" or "publickey". | keyword |
| system.auth.ssh.signature | The signature of the client public key. | keyword |

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Unit | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |  |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |  |
| system.fsstat.count | Number of file systems found. | long |  | gauge |

**ECS Field Reference**

Please refer to the following [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html) for detailed information on ECS fields.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type | Metric Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |  |
| agent.id | Unique identifier of this agent (if one exists). Example: For Beats this would be beat.id. | keyword |  |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |  |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |  |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |  |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |  |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host, resource, or service is located. | keyword |  |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |  |
| data_stream.dataset | The field can contain anything that makes sense to signify the source of the data. Examples include `nginx.access`, `prometheus`, `endpoint` etc. For data streams that otherwise fit, but that do not have dataset set we use the value "generic" for the dataset value. `event.dataset` should have the same value as `data_stream.dataset`. Beyond the Elasticsearch data stream naming criteria noted above, the `dataset` value has additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`. Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, `namespace` value has the additional restrictions:   \* Must not contain `-`   \* No longer than 100 characters | constant_keyword |  |
| data_stream.type | An overarching type for the data stream. Currently allowed values are "logs" and "metrics". We expect to also add "traces" and "synthetics" in the near future. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | constant_keyword |  |
| event.module | Name of the module this data is coming from. If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module. | constant_keyword |  |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |  |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what hostname returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or a name specified by the user. The recommended value is the lowercase FQDN of the host. | keyword |  |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |  |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |  |
| system.process.summary.dead | Number of dead processes on this host. It's very unlikely that it will appear but in some special situations it may happen. | long | gauge |
| system.process.summary.idle | Number of idle processes on this host. | long | gauge |
| system.process.summary.running | Number of running processes on this host. | long | gauge |
| system.process.summary.sleeping | Number of sleeping processes on this host. | long | gauge |
| system.process.summary.stopped | Number of stopped processes on this host. | long | gauge |
