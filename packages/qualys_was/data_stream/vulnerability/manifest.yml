        description: >-
          Default is true which retrieves the tags on web application data and results of scans. Verbose mode effects performance of the queries and the size of responses. Using a large batch size with verbose enabled could result in time out failures or non 200 responses from the Qualys endpoint. Verbose mode responses include a history of all scans ever made that tested for this vulnerability. we do not ingest or index this data. Consider a maintenance schedule of removing old scans to reduce the response size when verbose is enabled.

          Duration before declaring that the HTTP client connection has timed out. Supported time units are ns, us, ms, s, m, h. Requests may take significant time, so short timeouts are not recommended. When verbose mode is enabled, requests will take longer and require a longer connection timeout.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the data is parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.

        description: >-
          The request tracer logs HTTP requests and responses to the agent's local file-system for debugging configurations. Enabling this request tracing compromises security and should only be used for debugging. See [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-cel.html#_resource_tracer_filename) for details.
