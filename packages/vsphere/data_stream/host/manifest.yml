        description: The vSphere performance API allows for collecting host and datastore metrics at various intervals, including real-time (every 20 seconds), 5 minutes, or longer durations. Properly configuring the "period" parameter is crucial to manage usage restrictions and ensure accurate data collection. For more information on optimizing your data collection setup, refer to the [Data Collection Intervals](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-247646EA-A04B-411A-8DD4-62A3DCFCF49B.html) and [Data Collection Levels](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-25800DE4-68E5-41CC-82D9-8811E27924BC.html) documentation.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the events are shipped. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html) for details.
