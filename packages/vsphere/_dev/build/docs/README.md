# VMware vSphere Integration

## Overview

[vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html) is VMware's cloud computing virtualization platform, offering tools for managing virtualized data centers.

Use the vSphere integration to:

- Collect vSphere logs, along with datastore, host, and virtualmachine metrics for comprehensive monitoring and analysis.
- Create informative visualizations to track usage trends, measure key metrics, and derive actionable business insights.
- Set up alerts to minimize Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) by quickly referencing relevant logs during troubleshooting.

## Data streams

The vSphere integration collects logs and metrics.

Logs help you keep a record of events that happen on your machine. The `Log` data stream collected by vSphere as integration is `log`.

Metrics give you insight into the statistics of the vSphere. The `Metric` data stream collected by the vSphere integration are `cluster`, `datastore`, `datastorecluster`, `host`, `network`, `resourcepool` and `virtualmachine` so that the user can monitor and troubleshoot the performance of the vSphere instance.

Data Streams:

- **`log`**: This data stream collects logs generated by VMware vSphere using a syslog daemon.
- **`cluster`**: This data stream collects metrics from VMware vSphere, such as lists of datastores, hosts and networks associated with cluster.
- **`datastore`**: This data stream gathers datastore metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as capacity, usage, read/write operations, latency, and throughput.
- **`datastorecluster`**: This data stream gathers metrics for datastore clusters from VMware vSphere, including statistics like cluster capacity and available free space. Additionally, it provides information about the individual datastores that comprise the cluster.
- **`host`**: This data stream collects host metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network activity.
- **`resourcepool`**: This data stream collects metrics from VMware vSphere, such as CPU and memory usage, CPU and memory reservation, and CPU and memory limit.
- **`virtualmachine`**: This data stream gathers virtual machine metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as status, uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity.
- **`network`**: This data stream gathers metrics and status information related to VMware vSphere networks, including network accessibility, connected hosts and virtual machines, configuration health, and network type.

## Important Note
- Users can monitor and see the log inside the ingested documents for vSphere in the `logs-*` index pattern from `Discover`, and for metrics, the index pattern is `metrics-*`.
- **Supported Periods**:
    - Real-time data collection – An ESXi Server collects data for each performance counter every 20 seconds by default.
    - The Datastore and Host datastreams support performance data collection using the vSphere performance API.
    - Since the performance API has usage restrictions based on data collection intervals, users should ensure that the period is configured optimally to receive real-time data. Users can still collect summary metrics if performance metrics are not supported for the configured instance.
    - Period configuration can be determined based on the [Data Collection Intervals](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-247646EA-A04B-411A-8DD4-62A3DCFCF49B.html) and [Data Collection Levels](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-25800DE4-68E5-41CC-82D9-8811E27924BC.html).

## Prerequisites

You can store and search your data using Elasticsearch and visualize and manage it with Kibana. We recommend using our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud or self-managing the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested and verified against VMware ESXi and vCenter versions 7.0.3 and 8.0.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the [Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/starting-with-the-elasticsearch-platform-and-its-solutions/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Logs reference

### Log

This is the `log` data stream. This data stream collects logs generated by VMware vSphere using a syslog daemon.

Note:
- To collect logs, a syslog daemon is used. First, you must configure the listening host/IP address (default: localhost) and host port (default: 9525) in the integration. Then, configure vSphere to send logs to a remote syslog host and provide the configured hostname/IP and port of the Elastic Agent host.

## Metrics reference

Note:
- To access the metrics, provide the URL <https://host:port/sdk> in the "Add Integration" page of the vSphere package.

### Cluster
Clusters in vSphere represent a group of ESXi hosts working together to optimize resource allocation, ensure high availability, and manage workloads efficiently.
