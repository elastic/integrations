# VMware vSphere Integration

## Overview

[vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html) is VMware's cloud computing virtualization platform, offering tools for managing virtualized data centers.

Use the vSphere integration to:

- Collect vSphere logs, along with datastore, host, and virtualmachine metrics for comprehensive monitoring and analysis.
- Create informative visualizations to track usage trends, measure key metrics, and derive actionable business insights.
- Set up alerts to minimize Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) by quickly referencing relevant logs during troubleshooting.

## Data streams

The vSphere integration collects logs and metrics.

Logs help you keep a record of events that happen on your machine. The `Log` data stream collected by vSphere as integration is `log`.

Metrics give you insight into the statistics of the vSphere. The `Metric` data stream collected by the vSphere integration are `datastore`, `host` and `virtualmachine` so that the user can monitor and troubleshoot the performance of the vSphere instance.

Data streams:
- `log`: This data stream collects logs generated by VMware vSphere using a syslog daemon.
- `datastore`: This data stream collects datastore metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as capacity, usage, read/write operations, latency, and throughput. These metrics are available in this data stream.
- `host`: This data stream collects host metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network activity. These metrics are available in this data stream.
- `virtualmachine`: This data stream collects virtual machine metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as status, uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity. These metrics are available in this data stream.

Note:
- Users can monitor and see the log inside the ingested documents for vSphere in the `logs-*` index pattern from `Discover`, and for metrics, the index pattern is `metrics-*`.
- Real-time data collection â€“ An ESXi Server collects data for each performance counter every 20 seconds by default.
- Supported Periods:
- The Datastore and Host metricsets support performance data collection using the vSphere performance API.
- Since the performance API has usage restrictions based on data collection intervals,
- users should ensure that the period is configured optimally to receive real-time data.
- users can still collect summary metrics if performance metrics are not supported for the configured instance.
- This configuration can be determined based on the Data Collection Intervals and Data Collection Levels.

## Prerequisites

You can store and search your data using Elasticsearch and visualize and manage it with Kibana. We recommend using our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud or self-managing the Elastic Stack on your own hardware.

## Compatibility

This integration supports VMware ESXi and vCenter versions 6.5, 6.7, 7.0, and 7.0.3. It has been tested and verified to work with these versions.

## Setup

For step-by-step instructions on how to set up an integration, see the [Getting started](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/welcome-to-elastic/current/getting-started-observability.html) guide.

## Logs reference

### Log

This is the `log` data stream. This data stream collects logs generated by VMware vSphere using a syslog daemon.

Note:
- To collect logs, a syslog daemon is used. First, you must configure the listening host/IP address (default: localhost) and host port (default: 9525) in the integration. Then, configure vSphere to send logs to a remote syslog host and provide the configured hostname/IP and port of the Elastic Agent host.

## Metrics reference

Note:
- To access the metrics, provide the URL <https://host:port/sdk> in the "Add Integration" page of the vSphere package.

### Datastore

This is `datastore` data stream. This data stream collects datastore metrics from VMware vSphere, including performance statistics such as capacity, usage, read/write operations, latency, and throughput.
