# Google Security Command Center

## Overview

The [Google Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center) integration allows users to monitor finding, audit, asset, and source. Security Command Center Premium provides comprehensive threat detection for Google Cloud that includes Event Threat Detection, Container Threat Detection, and Virtual Machine Threat Detection as built-in services.

Use the Google SCC integration to collect and parse data from the Google SCC REST API (finding, asset, and source) or GCP Pub/Sub (finding, asset, and audit). Then visualize that data through search, correlation, and visualization within Elastic Security.

## Data streams

The Google SCC integration collects four types of data: finding, audit, asset, and source.

**Finding** is a record of assessment data like security, risk, health, or privacy, that is ingested into Security Command Center for presentation, notification, analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an App Engine application is a finding.

**Audit** logs created by Security Command Center as part of Cloud Audit Logs.

**Asset** lists assets with time and resource types and returns paged results in response.

**Source** is an entity or a mechanism that can produce a finding. A source is like a container of findings that come from the same scanner, logger, monitor, and other tools.

## Compatibility

This module has been tested against the latest Google SCC API version **v1**.

## Requirements

- Elastic Agent must be installed.
- You can install only one Elastic Agent per host.
- Elastic Agent is required to stream data from the GCP Pub/Sub or REST API and ship the data to Elastic, where the events will then be processed via the integration's ingest pipelines.

### Installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

You have a few options for installing and managing an Elastic Agent:

### Install a Fleet-managed Elastic Agent (recommended):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and use Fleet in Kibana to define, configure, and manage your agents in a central location. We recommend using Fleet management because it makes the management and upgrade of your agents considerably easier.

### Install Elastic Agent in standalone mode (advanced users):

With this approach, you install Elastic Agent and manually configure the agent locally on the system where itâ€™s installed. You are responsible for managing and upgrading the agents. This approach is reserved for advanced users only.

### Install Elastic Agent in a containerized environment:

You can run Elastic Agent inside a container, either with Fleet Server or standalone. Docker images for all versions of Elastic Agent are available from the Elastic Docker registry and we provide deployment manifests for running on Kubernetes.

There are some minimum requirements for running Elastic Agent and for more information, refer to the link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

The minimum **kibana.version** required is **8.8.0**.

## Prerequisites

   - Create Google SCC service account [Steps to create](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#creatinganaccount).
   - Permissions required for Service Account: 
      - Cloud Asset Viewer at Organization Level
      - Pub/Sub Subscriber at Project Level
      - Security Center Admin Editor at Organization Level
   - **Security Command Center API** and **Cloud Asset API** must be enabled.

This integration will make use of the following *oauth2 scope*:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`

Once Service Account credentials are downloaded as a JSON file, then the integration can be setup to collect data.

If installing in GCP-Cloud Environment, No need to provide any credentials and make sure the account linked with the VM has all the required IAM permissions. Steps to [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

## Setup

### To create GCP Pub/Sub, follow the below steps:

- [Create Topic for Pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-topic#create_a_topic).
- [Create Subscription for topic](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-subscription#create_subscriptions)

### To collect data from GCP Pub/Sub, follow the below steps:

- [Configure to export finding to GCP Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-notifications).
- [Configure to export asset to GCP Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/monitoring-asset-changes).
- [Configure to export audit to GCP Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2?_ga=2.110932226.-66737431.1679995682#overview).

**NOTE**:
   - **Sink destination** must be **Pub/Sub topic** while exporting audit logs to GCP Pub/Sub.
   - Create unique Pub/Sub topic per data-stream.

### Enabling the integration in Elastic:
1. In Kibana go to **Management > Integrations**.
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar, type **Google Security Command Center**.
3. Click on the **Google Security Command Center** integration from the search results.
4. Click on the **Add Google Security Command Center** Integration button to add the integration.
5. While adding the integration, if you want to **collect logs via Rest API**, turn on the toggle and then put the following details:
   - credentials type
   - credentials JSON/file
   - parent type
   - id
   - To collect **asset logs**, put the following details:
      - content type

   or if you want to **collect logs via GCP Pub/Sub**, turn on the toggle and then put the following details:
   - credentials type
   - credentials JSON/file
   - project id
   - To collect **asset, audit, or finding logs**, put the following details:
      - topic
      - subscription name

For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to serviceAccount:\{emailid\} and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding.  deleted:group:\{emailid\}?uid=\{uniqueid\}: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901.

For example, google.com or example.com. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.iam_policy.bindings.role | Role that is assigned to the list of members, or principals. For example, roles/viewer, roles/editor, or roles/owner. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.iam_policy.etag | etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. A base64-encoded string. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.iam_policy.version | Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding.Adding a conditional role binding to a policy.Changing a conditional role binding in a policy.Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.name | The full name of the asset. Example: //compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1. See Resource names for more information. | keyword |

| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.constraint | The name of the Constraint the Policy is configuring, for example, constraints/serviceuser.services. A list of available constraints is available. Immutable after creation. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.etag | An opaque tag indicating the current version of the Policy, used for concurrency control. When the Policy is returned from either a policies.get or a ListOrgPolicy request, this etag indicates the version of the current Policy to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the Policy is returned from a policies.getEffectivePolicy request, the etag will be unset. When the Policy is used in a SetOrgPolicy method, use the etag value that was returned from a GetOrgPolicy request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the etagin a SetOrgPolicy request will result in an unconditional write of the Policy. A base64-encoded string. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.list_policy.all_values | The policy allValues state. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.list_policy.allowed_values | List of values allowed at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.list_policy.denied_values | List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if allValues is set to ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.list_policy.inherit_from_parent | Determines the inheritance behavior for this Policy. | boolean |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.list_policy.suggested_value | Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this Policy. If suggestedValue is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless inheritFromParent is false. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.restore_default.etag | Output only. An opaque identifier for the current version of the AccessPolicy. This will always be a strongly validated etag, meaning that two Access Polices will be identical if and only if their etags are identical. Clients should not expect this to be in any specific format. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.restore_default.name | Output only. Resource name of the AccessPolicy. Format: accessPolicies/\{accessPolicy\}. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.restore_default.parent | Required. The parent of this AccessPolicy in the Cloud Resource Hierarchy. Currently immutable once created. Format: organizations/\{organization_id\}. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.restore_default.scopes | The scopes of a policy define which resources an ACM policy can restrict, and where ACM resources can be referenced. For example, a policy with scopes=["folders/123"] has the following behavior: - vpcsc perimeters can only restrict projects within folders/123 - access levels can only be referenced by resources within folders/123. If empty, there are no limitations on which resources can be restricted by an ACM policy, and there are no limitations on where ACM resources can be referenced. Only one policy can include a given scope (attempting to create a second policy which includes "folders/123" will result in an error). Currently, scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created. Currently, policies can only have a single scope. Format: list of folders/\{folder_number\} or projects/\{project_number\}. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.restore_default.title | Required. Human readable title. Does not affect behavior. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.update_time | The time stamp the Policy was previously updated. This is set by the server, not specified by the caller, and represents the last time a call to SetOrgPolicy was made for that Policy. Any value set by the client will be ignored. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z". | date |
| google_scc.asset.organization_policy.version | Version of the Policy. Default version is 0. | keyword |

| google_scc.asset.prior.iam_policy.etag | etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost. A base64-encoded string. | keyword |
| google_scc.asset.prior.iam_policy.version | Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.
