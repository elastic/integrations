            description: |-
              On Windows, the Network Packet Capture integration requires an Npcap DLL installation.
              This is provided by the integration for users of the Elastic Licenced version. In some
              cases users may wish to use their own installed version. In order to allow this, this
              option can be used. Setting it to `true` will disable installation of the bundled Npcap
              library.

              Note that if there is no Npcap installed the integration will not function, and versions
              of the Npcap library other than the bundled version may not provide functionality required
              by the integration.

            title: Configure BPF to account for VLAN tags
            description: |-
              Packetbeat automatically generates a BPF program for capturing only the traffic on ports where it expects to find known protocols.
              For example, if you have configured port 80 for HTTP and port 3306 for MySQL, Packetbeat generates the following BPF filter: "port 80 or port 3306".

              However, if the traffic contains VLAN tags, the filter that Packetbeat generates is ineffective because the offset is moved by four bytes.
              To fix this, you can enable the with_vlans option, which generates a BPF filter that looks like this: "port 80 or port 3306 or (vlan and (port 80 or port 3306))".

              If the ignore_outgoing option is enabled, Packetbeat ignores all the transactions initiated from the server running Packetbeat.
