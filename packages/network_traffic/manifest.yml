            description: |-
              On Windows, the Network Packet Capture integration requires an Npcap DLL installation.
              This is provided by the integration for users of the Elastic Licenced version. In some
              cases users may wish to use their own installed version. In order to allow this, this
              option can be used. Setting it to `true` will disable installation of the bundled Npcap
              library.

              Note that if there is no Npcap installed the integration will not function, and versions
              of the Npcap library other than the bundled version may not provide functionality required
              by the integration.
