        description: |-
          Remap any non-ECS Packetbeat fields in root to their correct ECS fields.
          This will rename fields that are moved so the fields will not be present
          at the root of the document and so any rules that depend on the fields
          will need to be updated.

          The legacy behaviour of this option is deprecated and users are encouraged
          to set this option to true. See details in the [package overview describing `map_to_ecs`](../../../integrations/detail/network_traffic/overview).
