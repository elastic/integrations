        title: Monitor Processes
        description: |-
          If this option is enabled then network traffic events will be enriched
          with information about the process associated with the events.

        title: Parseunknown
        description: |-
          Uncomment the parseunknown option to force the memcache text protocol parser
          to accept unknown commands.
          Note: All unknown commands MUST not contain any data parts!

        title: Maxvalues
        description: |-
          Update the maxvalue option to store the values - base64 encoded - in the
          json output.
          possible values:
             maxvalue: -1  store all values (text based protocol multi-get)
             maxvalue: 0   store no values at all
             maxvalue: N   store up to N values
          Default: 0

        description: |-
          Use maxbytespervalue to limit the number of bytes to be copied per value element.
          Note: Values will be base64 encoded, so actual size in json document
                will be 4 times maxbytespervalue.
          Default: unlimited

        description: |-
          UDP transaction timeout in milliseconds.
          Note: Quiet messages in UDP binary protocol will get response only in error case.
                The memcached analyzer will wait for udptransactiontimeout milliseconds
                before publishing quiet messages. Non quiet messages or quiet requests with
                error response will not have to wait for the timeout.
          Default: 200

        description: |-
          Transaction timeout. Expired transactions will no longer be correlated to
          incoming responses, but sent to Elasticsearch immediately. Valid time units are ns, us, ms, s, m, h.

        title: Map root Packetbeat fields to ECS
        description: |-
          Remap any non-ECS Packetbeat fields in root to their correct ECS fields.
          This will rename fields that are moved so the fields will not be present
          at the root of the document and so any rules that depend on the fields
          will need to be updated.

          The legacy behaviour of this option is deprecated and users are encouraged
          to set this option to true. See details in the [package overview describing `map_to_ecs`](../../../integrations/detail/network_traffic/overview).
