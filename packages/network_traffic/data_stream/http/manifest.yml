        description: |-
          Uncomment the following to hide certain parameters in URL or forms attached
          to HTTP requests. The names of the parameters are case insensitive.
          The value of the parameters will be replaced with the 'xxxxx' string.
          This is generally useful for avoiding storing user passwords or other
          sensitive information.
          Only query parameters and top level form parameters are replaced.
