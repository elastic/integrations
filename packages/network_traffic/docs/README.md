# Network Packet Capture Integration

This integration sniffs network packets on a host and dissects
known protocols.

Monitoring your network traffic is critical to gaining observability and
securing your environment — ensuring high levels of performance and security.
The Network Packet Capture integration captures the network traffic between
your application servers, decodes common application layer protocols and
records the interesting fields for each transaction.

## Supported Protocols

Currently, Network Packet Capture supports the following protocols:

-   ICMP (v4 and v6)
-   DHCP (v4)
-   DNS
-   HTTP
-   AMQP 0.9.1
-   Cassandra
-   Mysql
-   PostgreSQL
-   Redis
-   Thrift-RPC
-   MongoDB
-   Memcache
-   NFS
-   TLS
-   SIP/SDP (beta)

### Common protocol options

The following options are available for all protocols:

#### `enabled`

The enabled setting is a boolean setting to enable or disable protocols
without having to comment out configuration sections. If set to false,
the protocol is disabled.

The default value is true.

#### `ports`

Exception: For ICMP the option `enabled` has to be used instead.

The ports where Network Packet Capture will look to capture traffic for specific
protocols. Network Packet Capture installs a
[BPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) filter based
on the ports specified in this section. If a packet doesn’t match the
filter, very little CPU is required to discard the packet. Network Packet Capture
also uses the ports specified here to determine which parser to use for
each packet.

#### `monitor_processes`

If this option is enabled then network traffic events will be enriched
with information about the process associated with the events.

The default value is false.

#### `send_request`

If this option is enabled, the raw message of the request (`request`
field) is sent to Elasticsearch. The default is false. This option is
useful when you want to index the whole request. Note that for HTTP, the
body is not included by default, only the HTTP headers.

#### `send_response`

If this option is enabled, the raw message of the response (`response`
field) is sent to Elasticsearch. The default is false. This option is
useful when you want to index the whole response. Note that for HTTP,
the body is not included by default, only the HTTP headers.

#### `transaction_timeout`

The per protocol transaction timeout. Expired transactions will no
longer be correlated to incoming responses, but sent to Elasticsearch
immediately.

#### `tags`

A list of tags that will be sent with the transaction event. This
setting is optional.

#### `processors`

A list of processors to apply to the data generated by the protocol.

#### `keep_null`

If this option is set to true, fields with `null` values will be
published in the output document. By default, `keep_null` is set to
`false`.


## Network Flows

Overall flow information about the network connections on a
host.

You can configure Network Packet Capture to collect and report statistics
on network flows. A *flow* is a group of packets sent over the same time
period that share common properties, such as the same source and destination
address and protocol. You can use this feature to analyze network
traffic over specific protocols on your network.

For each flow, Network Packet Capture reports the number of packets and the
total number of bytes sent from the source to the destination. Each flow event
also contains information about the source and destination hosts, such
as their IP address. For bi-directional flows, Network Packet Capture reports
statistics for the reverse flow.

Network Packet Capture collects and reports statistics up to and including the
transport layer.

**Configuration options**

You can specify the following options for capturing flows.

#### `enabled`

Enables flows support if set to true. Set to false to disable network
flows support without having to delete or comment out the flows section.
The default value is true.

#### `timeout`

Timeout configures the lifetime of a flow. If no packets have been
received for a flow within the timeout time window, the flow is killed
and reported. The default value is 30s.

#### `period`

Configure the reporting interval. All flows are reported at the very
same point in time. Periodical reporting can be disabled by setting the
value to -1. If disabled, flows are still reported once being timed out.
The default value is 10s.

Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |

## Protocols

### AMQP

**Configuration options**

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `max_body_length`

The maximum size in bytes of the message displayed in the request or
response fields. Messages that are bigger than the specified size are
truncated. Use this option to avoid publishing huge messages when
[`send_request`](#send-request-option) or
[`send_response`](#send-response-option) is enabled. The default is
1000 bytes.

#### `parse_headers`

If set to true, Network Packet Capture parses the additional arguments specified in
the headers field of a message. Those arguments are key-value pairs that
specify information such as the content type of the message or the
message priority. The default is true.

#### `parse_arguments`

If set to true, Network Packet Capture parses the additional arguments specified in
AMQP methods. Those arguments are key-value pairs specified by the user
and can be of any length. The default is true.

#### `hide_connection_information`

If set to false, the connection layer methods of the protocol are also
displayed, such as the opening and closing of connections and channels
by clients, or the quality of service negotiation. The default is true.

For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| params | The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request. | text |
| path | The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key. | keyword |
| process.args | Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable. May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | keyword |
| process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | keyword |
| process.executable.text | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | match_only_text |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |

| process.start | The time the process started. | date |
| process.working_directory | The working directory of the process. | keyword |
| process.working_directory.text | Multi-field of `process.working_directory`. | match_only_text |
| query | The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |
| response | For text protocols, this is the response as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| server.bytes | Bytes sent from the server to the client. | long |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| server.port | Port of the server. | long |

| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| status | The high level status of the transaction. The way to compute this value depends on the protocol, but the result has a meaning independent of the protocol. | keyword |
| type | The type of the transaction (for example, HTTP, MySQL, Redis, or RUM) or "flow" in case of flows. | keyword |

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| params | The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request. | text |
| path | The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key. | keyword |
| process.args | Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable. May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | keyword |
| process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | keyword |
| process.executable.text | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | match_only_text |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |

| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |
| response | For text protocols, this is the response as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| server.bytes | Bytes sent from the server to the client. | long |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |

| dns.additionals_count | The number of resource records contained in the `dns.additionals` field. The `dns.additionals` field may or may not be included depending on the configuration of Packetbeat. | long |
| dns.answers | An array containing an object for each answer section returned by the server. The main keys that should be present in these objects are defined by ECS. Records that have more information may contain more keys than what ECS defines. Not all DNS data sources give all details about DNS answers. At minimum, answer objects must contain the `data` key. If more information is available, map as much of it to ECS as possible, and add any additional fields to the answer objects as custom fields. | object |
| dns.answers.class | The class of DNS data contained in this resource record. | keyword |
| dns.answers.data | The data describing the resource. The meaning of this data depends on the type and class of the resource record. | keyword |
| dns.answers.name | The domain name to which this resource record pertains. If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated. | keyword |

| dns.opt.ext_rcode | Extended response code field. | keyword |
| dns.opt.udp_size | Requestor's UDP payload size (in bytes). | long |
| dns.opt.version | The EDNS version. | keyword |
| dns.question.class | The class of records being queried. | keyword |
| dns.question.etld_plus_one | The effective top-level domain (eTLD) plus one more label. For example, the eTLD+1 for "foo.bar.golang.org." is "golang.org.". The data for determining the eTLD comes from an embedded copy of the data from http://publicsuffix.org. | keyword |
| dns.question.name | The name being queried. If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively. | keyword |
| dns.question.registered_domain | The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.subdomain | The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain. If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| dns.question.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| dns.resolved_ip | Array containing all IPs seen in `answers.data`. The `answers` array can be difficult to use, because of the variety of data formats it can contain. Extracting all IP addresses seen in there to `dns.resolved_ip` makes it possible to index them as IP addresses, and makes them easier to visualize and query for. | ip |
| dns.response_code | The DNS response code. | keyword |
| dns.type | The type of DNS event captured, query or answer. If your source of DNS events only gives you DNS queries, you should only create dns events of type `dns.type:query`. If your source of DNS events gives you answers as well, you should create one event per query (optionally as soon as the query is seen). And a second event containing all query details as well as an array of answers. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| params | The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request. | text |
| path | The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key. | keyword |
| process.args | Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable. May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | keyword |
| process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | keyword |
| process.executable.text | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | match_only_text |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.name.text | Multi-field of `process.name`. | match_only_text |
| process.start | The time the process started. | date |
| process.working_directory | The working directory of the process. | keyword |
| process.working_directory.text | Multi-field of `process.working_directory`. | match_only_text |
| query | The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |
| response | For text protocols, this is the response as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| server.bytes | Bytes sent from the server to the client. | long |

### HTTP

**Configuration options**

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `hide_keywords`

A list of query parameters that Network Packet Capture will automatically censor in
the transactions that it saves. The values associated with these
parameters are replaced by `'xxxxx'`. By default, no changes are made to
the HTTP messages.

Network Packet Capture has this option because, unlike SQL traffic, which typically
only contains the hashes of the passwords, HTTP traffic may contain
sensitive data. To reduce security risks, you can configure this option
to avoid sending the contents of certain HTTP POST parameters.

This option replaces query parameters from GET requests and top-level
parameters from POST requests. If sensitive data is encoded inside a
parameter that you don’t specify here, Network Packet Capture cannot censor it.
Also, note that if you configure Network Packet Capture to save the raw request and
response fields (see the [`send_request`](#send-request-option) and
the [`send_response`](#send-response-option) options), sensitive data
may be present in those fields.

#### `redact_authorization`

When this option is enabled, Network Packet Capture obscures the value of
`Authorization` and `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP headers, and censors
those strings in the response.

You should set this option to true for transactions that use Basic
Authentication because they may contain the base64 unencrypted username
and password.

#### `send_headers`

A list of header names to capture and send to Elasticsearch. These
headers are placed under the `headers` dictionary in the resulting JSON.

#### `send_all_headers`

Instead of sending a white list of headers to Elasticsearch, you can
send all headers by setting this option to true. The default is false.

#### `redact_headers`

A list of headers to redact if present in the HTTP request. This will
keep the header field present, but will redact it’s value to show the
header’s presence.

#### `include_body_for`

The list of content types for which Network Packet Capture exports the full HTTP
payload. The HTTP body is available under `http.request.body.content`
and `http.response.body.content` for these Content-Types.

In addition, if [`send_response`](#send-response-option) option is
enabled, then the HTTP body is exported together with the HTTP headers
under `response` and if [`send_request`](#send-request-option)
enabled, then `request` contains the entire HTTP message including the
body.

In the following example, the HTML attachments of the HTTP responses are
exported under the `response` field and under
`http.request.body.content` or `http.response.body.content`:

```yaml
Network Packet Capture.protocols:
- type: http
  ports: [80, 8080]
  send_response: true
  include_body_for: ["text/html"]
```

#### `decode_body`

A boolean flag that controls decoding of HTTP payload. It interprets the
`Content-Encoding` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers and uncompresses the
entity body. Supported encodings are `gzip` and `deflate`. This option
is only applicable in the cases where the HTTP payload is exported, that
is, when one of the `include_*_body_for` options is specified or a POST
request contains url-encoded parameters.

#### `split_cookie`

If the `Cookie` or `Set-Cookie` headers are sent, this option controls
whether they are split into individual values. For example, with this
option set, an HTTP response might result in the following JSON:

```json
"response": {
  "code": 200,
  "headers": {
    "connection": "close",

The default is false.

#### `real_ip_header`

The header field to extract the real IP from. This setting is useful
when you want to capture traffic behind a reverse proxy, but you want to
get the geo-location information. If this header is present and contains
a valid IP addresses, the information is used for the
`network.forwarded_ip` field.

#### `max_message_size`

If an individual HTTP message is larger than this setting (in bytes), it
will be trimmed to this size. Unless this value is very small
(less than 1.5K), Network Packet Capture is able to still correctly follow the transaction
and create an event for it. The default is 10485760 (10 MB).

When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |

### Memcached

**Configuration options**

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `parseunknown`

When this option is enabled, it forces the memcache text protocol parser
to accept unknown commands.

The unknown commands MUST NOT contain a data part.

#### `maxvalues`

The maximum number of values to store in the message (multi-get). All
values will be base64 encoded.

The possible settings for this option are:

-   `maxvalue: -1`, which stores all values (text based protocol multi-get)
-   `maxvalue: 0`, which stores no values (default)
-   `maxvalue: N`, which stores up to N values

#### `maxbytespervalue`

The maximum number of bytes to be copied for each value element.

Values will be base64 encoded, so the actual size in the JSON document
will be 4 times the value that you specify for `maxbytespervalue`.

#### `udptransactiontimeout`

The transaction timeout in milliseconds. The defaults is 10000
milliseconds.

Quiet messages in UDP binary protocol get responses only if there is an
error. The memcache protocol analyzer will wait for the number of
milliseconds specified by `udptransactiontimeout` before publishing
quiet messages. Non-quiet messages or quiet requests with an error
response are published immediately.

| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.bytes | Bytes sent from the destination to the source. | long |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |

### MongoDB

**Configuration options**

The `max_docs` and `max_doc_length` settings are useful for limiting the
amount of data Network Packet Capture indexes in the `response` fields.

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `max_docs`

The maximum number of documents from the response to index in the
`response` field. The default is 10. You can set this to 0 to index an
unlimited number of documents.

Network Packet Capture adds a `[...]` line at the end to signify that there were
additional documents that weren’t saved because of this setting.

#### `max_doc_length`

The maximum number of characters in a single document indexed in the
`response` field. The default is 5000. You can set this to 0 to index an
unlimited number of characters per document.

If the document is trimmed because of this setting, Network Packet Capture adds the
string `...` at the end of the document.

Note that limiting documents in this way means that they are no longer
correctly formatted JSON objects.

| destination.bytes | Bytes sent from the destination to the source. | long |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| mongodb.cursorId | The cursor identifier returned in the OP_REPLY. This must be the value that was returned from the database. | keyword |
| mongodb.error | If the MongoDB request has resulted in an error, this field contains the error message returned by the server. | keyword |
| mongodb.fullCollectionName | The full collection name. The full collection name is the concatenation of the database name with the collection name, using a dot (.) for the concatenation. For example, for the database foo and the collection bar, the full collection name is foo.bar. | keyword |
| mongodb.numberReturned | The number of documents in the reply. | long |
| mongodb.numberToReturn | The requested maximum number of documents to be returned. | long |
| mongodb.numberToSkip | Sets the number of documents to omit - starting from the first document in the resulting dataset - when returning the result of the query. | long |
| mongodb.query | A JSON document that represents the query. The query will contain one or more elements, all of which must match for a document to be included in the result set. Possible elements include $query, $orderby, $hint, $explain, and $snapshot. | keyword |
| mongodb.returnFieldsSelector | A JSON document that limits the fields in the returned documents. The returnFieldsSelector contains one or more elements, each of which is the name of a field that should be returned, and the integer value 1. | keyword |
| mongodb.selector | A BSON document that specifies the query for selecting the document to update or delete. | keyword |
| mongodb.startingFrom | Where in the cursor this reply is starting. | keyword |
| mongodb.update | A BSON document that specifies the update to be performed. For information on specifying updates, see the Update Operations documentation from the MongoDB Manual. | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| params | The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request. | text |
| path | The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key. | keyword |
| process.args | Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable. May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | keyword |
| process.executable | Absolute path to the process executable. | keyword |
| process.executable.text | Multi-field of `process.executable`. | match_only_text |

| process.working_directory.text | Multi-field of `process.working_directory`. | match_only_text |
| query | The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |

| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| params | The request parameters. For HTTP, these are the POST or GET parameters. For Thrift-RPC, these are the parameters from the request. | text |
| path | The path the transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL. For SQL databases, this is the table name. For key-value stores, this is the key. | keyword |
| pgsql.error_code | The PostgreSQL error code. | keyword |
| pgsql.error_message | The PostgreSQL error message. | keyword |
| pgsql.error_severity | The PostgreSQL error severity. | keyword |
| pgsql.num_fields | If the SELECT query if successful, this field is set to the number of fields returned. | long |
| pgsql.num_rows | If the SELECT query if successful, this field is set to the number of rows returned. | long |
| process.args | Array of process arguments, starting with the absolute path to the executable. May be filtered to protect sensitive information. | keyword |

| process.working_directory | The working directory of the process. | keyword |
| process.working_directory.text | Multi-field of `process.working_directory`. | match_only_text |
| query | The query in a human readable format. For HTTP, it will typically be something like `GET /users/_search?name=test`. For MySQL, it is something like `SELECT id from users where name=test`. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |

### Redis

**Configuration options**

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `queue_max_bytes` and `queue_max_messages`

store requests in memory until a response is received. These settings
impose a limit on the number of bytes (`queue_max_bytes`) and number of
requests (`queue_max_messages`) that can be stored. These limits are
per-connection. The default is to queue up to 1MB or 20.000 requests per
connection, which allows to use request pipelining while at the same
time limiting the amount of memory consumed by replication sessions.

| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |

| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |

| redis.error | If the Redis command has resulted in an error, this field contains the error message returned by the Redis server. | keyword |
| redis.return_value | The return value of the Redis command in a human readable format. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| request | For text protocols, this is the request as seen on the wire (application layer only). For binary protocols this is our representation of the request. | text |
| resource | The logical resource that this transaction refers to. For HTTP, this is the URL path up to the last slash (/). For example, if the URL is `/users/1`, the resource is `/users`. For databases, the resource is typically the table name. The field is not filled for all transaction types. | keyword |

| destination.bytes | Bytes sent from the destination to the source. | long |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.reason | Reason why this event happened, according to the source. This describes the why of a particular action or outcome captured in the event. Where `event.action` captures the action from the event, `event.reason` describes why that action was taken. For example, a web proxy with an `event.action` which denied the request may also populate `event.reason` with the reason why (e.g. `blocked site`). | keyword |
| event.sequence | Sequence number of the event. The sequence number is a value published by some event sources, to make the exact ordering of events unambiguous, regardless of the timestamp precision. | long |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |

| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |

| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |

| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.application | When a specific application or service is identified from network connection details (source/dest IPs, ports, certificates, or wire format), this field captures the application's or service's name. For example, the original event identifies the network connection being from a specific web service in a `https` network connection, like `facebook` or `twitter`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |

| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |

### Thrift

[Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) is a communication protocol
and RPC framework initially created at Facebook. It is sometimes used in
[microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
architectures because it provides better performance when compared to
the more obvious HTTP/RESTful API choice, while still supporting a wide
range of programming languages and frameworks.

Network Packet Capture works based on a copy of the traffic, which means that you
get performance management features without having to modify your
services in any way and without any latency overhead. Network Packet Capture
captures the transactions from the network and indexes them in
Elasticsearch so that they can be analyzed and searched.

Network Packet Capture indexes the method, parameters, return value, and exceptions
of each Thrift-RPC call. You can search by and create statistics based
on any of these fields. Network Packet Capture automatically fills in the `status`
column with either `OK` or `Error`, so it’s easy to find the problematic
RPC calls. A transaction is put into the `Error` state if it returned an
exception.

Network Packet Capture also indexes the `event.duration` field so you can get
performance analytics and find the slow RPC calls.

Thrift supports multiple [transport and protocol
types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift). Currently Network Packet Capture
supports the default `TSocket` transport as well as the `TFramed`
transport. From the protocol point of view, Network Packet Capture currently
supports only the default `TBinary` protocol.

Network Packet Capture also has several configuration options that allow you to get
the right balance between visibility, disk usage, and data protection.
You can, for example, choose to obfuscate all strings or to store the
requests but not the responses, while still capturing the response time
for each of the RPC calls. You can also choose to limit the size of
strings and lists to a given number of elements, so you can fine tune
how much data you want to have stored in Elasticsearch.

The Thrift protocol has several specific configuration options.

Providing the Thrift IDL files to Network Packet Capture is optional. The binary
Thrift messages include the called method name and enough structural
information to decode the messages without needing the IDL files.
However, if you provide the IDL files, Network Packet Capture can also resolve the
service name, arguments, and exception names.

**Configuration options**

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `transport_type`

The Thrift transport type. Currently this option accepts the values
`socket` for TSocket, which is the default Thrift transport, and
`framed` for the TFramed Thrift transport. The default is `socket`.

#### `protocol_type`

The Thrift protocol type. Currently the only accepted value is `binary`
for the TBinary protocol, which is the default Thrift protocol.

#### `idl_files`

The Thrift interface description language (IDL) files for the service
that Network Packet Capture is monitoring. Providing the IDL files is optional,
because the Thrift messages contain enough information to decode them
without having the IDL files. However, providing the IDL enables
Network Packet Capture to include parameter and exception names.

#### `string_max_size`

The maximum length for strings in parameters or return values. If a
string is longer than this value, the string is automatically truncated
to this length. Network Packet Capture adds dots at the end of the string to mark
that it was truncated. The default is 200.

#### `collection_max_size`

The maximum number of elements in a Thrift list, set, map, or structure.
If a collection has more elements than this value, Network Packet Capture captures
only the specified number of elements. Network Packet Capture adds a fictive last
element `...` to the end of the collection to mark that it was
truncated. The default is 15.

#### `capture_reply`

If this option is set to false, Network Packet Capture decodes the method name from
the reply and simply skips the rest of the response message. This
setting can be useful for performance, disk usage, or data retention
reasons. The default is true.

#### `obfuscate_strings`

If this option is set to true, Network Packet Capture replaces all strings found in
method parameters, return codes, or exception structures with the `"*"`
string.

#### `drop_after_n_struct_fields`

The maximum number of fields that a structure can have before Network Packet Capture
ignores the whole transaction. This is a memory protection mechanism (so
that Network Packet Capture’s memory doesn’t grow indefinitely), so you would
typically set this to a relatively high value. The default is 500.

| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| destination.bytes | Bytes sent from the destination to the source. | long |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from. It's recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name. | keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.end | event.end contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| flow.final | Indicates if event is last event in flow. If final is false, the event reports an intermediate flow state only. | boolean |
| flow.id | Internal flow ID based on connection meta data and address. | keyword |
| flow.vlan | VLAN identifier from the 802.1q frame. In case of a multi-tagged frame this field will be an array with the outer tag's VLAN identifier listed first. | long |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |

### TLS

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communications on
top of an existing application protocol, like HTTP or MySQL.

Network Packet Capture intercepts the initial handshake in a TLS connection and
extracts useful information that helps operators diagnose problems and
strengthen the security of their network and systems. It does not
decrypt any information from the encapsulated protocol, nor does it
reveal any sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. TLS
versions 1.0 to 1.3 are supported.

It works by intercepting the client and server "hello" messages, which
contain the negotiated parameters for the connection such as
cryptographic ciphers and protocol versions. It can also intercept TLS
alerts, which are sent by one of the parties to signal a problem with
the negotiation, such as an expired certificate or a cryptographic
error.

Detailed information that is not defined in ECS is added under the
`tls.detailed` key. The [`include_detailed_fields`](#include_detailed_fields) configuration flag
is used to control whether this information is exported.

The fields under `tls.detailed.client_hello` contain the algorithms and
extensions supported by the client, as well as the maximum TLS version
it supports.

Fields under `tls.detailed.server_hello` contain the final settings for
the TLS session: The selected cipher, compression method, TLS version to
use and other extensions such as application layer protocol negotiation
(ALPN).

**Configuration options**

The `send_certificates` and `include_detailed_fields` settings are
useful for limiting the amount of data Network Packet Capture indexes, as multiple
certificates are usually exchanged in a single transaction, and those
can take a considerable amount of storage.

Also see [Common protocol options](#common-protocol-options).

#### `send_certificates`

This setting causes information about the certificates presented by the
client and server to be included in the detailed fields. The server’s
certificate is indexed under `tls.detailed.server_certificate` and its
certification chain under `tls.detailed.server_certificate_chain`. For
the client, the `client_certificate` and `client_certificate_chain`
fields are used. The default is true.

#### `include_raw_certificates`

You can set `include_raw_certificates` to include the raw certificate
chains encoded in PEM format, under the `tls.server.certificate_chain`
and `tls.client.certificate_chain` fields. The default is false.

#### `include_detailed_fields`

Controls whether the [TLS fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/exported-fields-tls_detailed.html) are added to exported documents. When
set to false, only [ECS TLS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/8.2/ecs-tls.html) fields are included.
exported are included. The default is `true`.

#### `fingerprints`

Defines a list of hash algorithms to calculate the certificate’s
fingerprints. Valid values are `sha1`, `sha256` and `md5`.

The default is to output SHA-1 fingerprints.

| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset. If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.start | event.start contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed. | date |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization.

| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |

| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| method | The command/verb/method of the transaction. For HTTP, this is the method name (GET, POST, PUT, and so on), for SQL this is the verb (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on). | keyword |

| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
