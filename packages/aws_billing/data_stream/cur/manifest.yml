        default: 24h
        description: >
          Set to 24h or more to match the report's daily update cycle and avoid re-ingesting data. AWS CUR reports are cumulative and are updated multiple times per day. Setting a short interval (e.g., 1h) will cause the same report to be ingested repeatedly, leading to significant data duplication. A 24-hour or longer interval is recommended to capture the final daily report.

          Enabling this option sets the bucket name as a path in the API call instead of a subdomain. When enabled https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.<provider>.com becomes https://s3.<region>.<provider>.com/<bucket-name>. This is only supported with 3rd party S3 providers.
