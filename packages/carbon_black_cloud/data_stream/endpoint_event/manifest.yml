        description: "If the SQS queue will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldn’t process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded. \nThis is a list of selectors which are made up of regex and expand_event_list_from_field options. The regex should match the S3 object key in the SQS message, and the optional expand_event_list_from_field is the same as the global setting. \nIf file_selectors is given, then any global expand_event_list_from_field value is ignored in favor of the ones specified in the file_selectors. \nRegexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed.\n[NOTE]: It is recommended to use data stream specific SQS queues instead of file_selectors to avoid data loss."

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
