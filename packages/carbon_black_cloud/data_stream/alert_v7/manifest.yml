        description: "If the SQS queue will have events that correspond to files that this integration shouldn’t process, file_selectors can be used to limit the files that are downloaded. \nThis is a list of selectors which are made up of regex and expand_event_list_from_field options. The regex should match the S3 object key in the SQS message, and the optional expand_event_list_from_field is the same as the global setting. \nIf file_selectors is given, then any global expand_event_list_from_field value is ignored in favor of the ones specified in the file_selectors. \nRegexes use [RE2 syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax). Files that don’t match one of the regexes will not be processed.\n[NOTE]: It is recommended to use data stream specific SQS queues instead of file_selectors to avoid data loss."
