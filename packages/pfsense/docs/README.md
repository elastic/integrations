# pfSense Integration

This is an integration to parse certain logs from the PFsense firewall. It parses logs
received over the network via syslog (UDP). Currently the integration supports parsing the
Firewall, Unbound, DHCP Daemon, OpenVPN, IPsec, and HAProxy logs.  All other events will be dropped.
The firewall, VPN, DHCP, and DNS logs are able to be individually selected via the "Remote Logging Options"
section within the pfSense settings page.  In order to collect HAProxy or other "package" logs, the "Everything" option
must be selected. The module is by default configured to run with the `udp` input on port `9001`.

*The HAProxy logs are setup to be compatible with the dashboards from the HAProxy integration.  Install the HAPrxoy integration assets to utilize them.

**Important**  
The pfSense integration supports both the BSD logging format and the Syslog format.
However the syslog format is recommended. It will provide the firewall hostname and timestamps with timezone information.
When using the BSD format, the `Timezone Offset` config must be set when deploying the agent or else the timezone will default to the timezone of the agent. See `https://<pfsense url>/status_logs_settings.php` and https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/monitoring/logs/settings.html for more information.


## Logs

### pfSense log

This is the pfSense `log` dataset.

An example event for `log` looks as following:

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| client.address | Some event client addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |

| destination.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| destination.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| destination.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |

| destination.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| destination.ip | IP address of the destination (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| dns.question.class | The class of records being queried. | keyword |
| dns.question.name | The name being queried. If the name field contains non-printable characters (below 32 or above 126), those characters should be represented as escaped base 10 integers (\DDD). Back slashes and quotes should be escaped. Tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds should be converted to \t, \r, and \n respectively. | keyword |
| dns.question.registered_domain | The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.subdomain | The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain. If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| dns.question.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| dns.type | The type of DNS event captured, query or answer. If your source of DNS events only gives you DNS queries, you should only create dns events of type `dns.type:query`. If your source of DNS events gives you answers as well, you should create one event per query (optionally as soon as the query is seen). And a second event containing all query details as well as an array of answers. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.id | Unique ID to describe the event. | keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| haproxy.backend_name | Name of the backend (or listener) which was selected to manage the connection to the server. | keyword |
| haproxy.backend_queue | Total number of requests which were processed before this one in the backend's global queue. | long |

| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |

| hostname | Hostname from syslog header. | keyword |
| http.request.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the request body. | long |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. Prior to ECS 1.6.0 the following guidance was provided: "The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying." As of ECS 1.6.0, the guidance is deprecated because the original case of the method may be useful in anomaly detection.  Original case will be mandated in ECS 2.0.0 | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| http.response.body.bytes | Size in bytes of the response body. | long |
| http.response.bytes | Total size in bytes of the response (body and headers). | long |
| http.response.status_code | HTTP response status code. | long |
| http.version | HTTP version. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.source.address | Source address of the syslog message. | keyword |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.community_id | A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify flows. Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec. | keyword |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.iana_number | IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number. | keyword |

| network.protocol | L7 Network protocol name. ex. http, lumberjack, transport protocol. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS". | keyword |
| network.transport | Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.) The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS". | keyword |
| network.type | In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec, pim, etc The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the documentation section "Implementing ECS". | keyword |

| rule.id | A rule ID that is unique within the scope of an agent, observer, or other entity using the rule for detection of this event. | keyword |
| server.address | Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| server.bytes | Bytes sent from the server to the client. | long |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| server.port | Port of the server. | long |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.bytes | Bytes sent from the source to the destination. | long |
| source.domain | Source domain. | keyword |
| source.geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| source.geo.continent_name | Name of the continent. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_iso_code | Country ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| source.geo.location | Longitude and latitude. | geo_point |
| source.geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_iso_code | Region ISO code. | keyword |
| source.geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| source.ip | IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| source.mac | MAC address of the source. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| source.nat.ip | Translated ip of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | ip |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| source.user.full_name | User's full name, if available. | keyword |
| source.user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| tls.cipher | String indicating the cipher used during the current connection. | keyword |
| tls.version | Numeric part of the version parsed from the original string. | keyword |
| tls.version_protocol | Normalized lowercase protocol name parsed from original string. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.extension | The field contains the file extension from the original request url, excluding the leading dot. The file extension is only set if it exists, as not every url has a file extension. The leading period must not be included. For example, the value must be "png", not ".png". Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| url.full | If full URLs are important to your use case, they should be stored in `url.full`, whether this field is reconstructed or present in the event source. | wildcard |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.password | Password of the request. | keyword |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.port | Port of the request, such as 443. | long |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.scheme | Scheme of the request, such as "https". Note: The `:` is not part of the scheme. | keyword |
| url.username | Username of the request. | keyword |
| user.domain | Name of the directory the user is a member of. For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name. | keyword |
| user.email | User email address. | keyword |

| user_agent.device.name | Name of the device. | keyword |
| user_agent.name | Name of the user agent. | keyword |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.full | Operating system name, including the version or code name. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| user_agent.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
