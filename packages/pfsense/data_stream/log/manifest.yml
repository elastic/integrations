          By default, datetimes (with no timezone) in the logs will be interpreted as relative to the timezone configured in the host where the agent is running. If ingesting logs from a host on a different timezone, use this field to set the timezone offset so that datetimes are correctly parsed. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00") from UCT.

          Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to enhance the event with metadata. This executes in the agent before the logs are parsed. See [Processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html) for details.
