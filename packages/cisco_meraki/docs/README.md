# Cisco Meraki Integration

Cisco Meraki offers a centralized cloud management platform for all Meraki devices such as MX Security Appliances, MR Access Points and so on. Its out-of-band cloud architecture creates secure, scalable and easy-to-deploy networks that can be managed from anywhere. This can be done from almost any device using web-based Meraki Dashboard and Meraki Mobile App. Each Meraki network generates its own events.

Cisco Meraki offers [several methods for device reporting](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/Meraki_Device_Reporting_-_Syslog%2C_SNMP%2C_and_API). This integration supports gathering events via the Cisco Meraki syslog and via API reporting webhooks. The integration package allows you to search, observe, and visualize the events through Elasticsearch.

## Compatibility

A syslog server can be configured to store messages for reporting purposes from MX Security Appliances, MR Access Points, and MS switches. This package collects events from the configured syslog server. The integration supports collection of events from "MX Security Appliances" and "MR Access Points". The "MS Switch" events are not recognized.

## Configuration

### Enabling the integration in Elastic

1. In Kibana go to **Management > Integrations**
2. In "Search for integrations" search bar type **Meraki**
3. Click on "Cisco Meraki" integration from the search results.
4. Click on **Add Cisco Meraki Integration** button to add the integration.

### Cisco Meraki Dashboard Configuration

#### Syslog

Cisco Meraki dashboard can be used to configure one or more syslog servers and Meraki message types to be sent to the syslog servers. Refer to [Syslog Server Overview and Configuration](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/Syslog_Server_Overview_and_Configuration#Configuring_a_Syslog_Server) page for more information on how to configure syslog server on Cisco Meraki.

#### API Endpoint (Webhooks)

Cisco Meraki dashboard can be used to configure Meraki webhooks. Refer to the [Webhooks Dashboard Setup](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Monitoring_and_Reporting/Meraki_Device_Reporting_-_Syslog%2C_SNMP%2C_and_API#Webhooks_Dashboard_Setup) section.

### Configure the Cisco Meraki integration

#### Syslog

Depending on the syslog server setup in your environment check one/more of the following options "Collect syslog from Cisco Meraki via UDP", "Collect syslog from Cisco Meraki via TCP", "Collect syslog from Cisco Meraki via file".

Enter the values for syslog host and port OR file path based on the chosen configuration options.

### API Endpoint (Webhooks)

Check the option "Collect events from Cisco Meraki via Webhooks" option.

1. Enter values for "Listen Address", "Listen Port" and "Webhook path" to form the endpoint URL. Make note of the **Endpoint URL** `https://{AGENT_ADDRESS}:8686/meraki/events`.
2. Enter value for "Secret value". This must match the "Shared Secret" value entered when configuring the webhook from Meraki cloud.
3. Enter values for "TLS". Cisco Meraki requires that the webhook accept requests over HTTPS. So you must either configure the integration with a valid TLS certificate or use a reverse proxy in front of the integration.

### Log Events

Enable to collect Cisco Meraki log events for all the applications configured for the chosen log stream.

## Logs

### Syslog

The `cisco_meraki.log` dataset provides events from the configured syslog server. All Cisco Meraki syslog specific fields are available in the `cisco_meraki.log` field group.

This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| client.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |

| destination.address | Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| destination.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |

| destination.nat.port | Port the source session is translated to by NAT Device. Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | long |
| destination.port | Port of the destination. | long |
| destination.registered_domain | The highest registered destination domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| destination.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| destination.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.answers.name | The domain name to which this resource record pertains. If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated. | keyword |
| dns.answers.type | The type of data contained in this resource record. | keyword |
| dns.question.registered_domain | The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org).

For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.attributes | Array of file attributes. Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted, execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write. | keyword |
| file.directory | Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.extension | File extension, excluding the leading dot. Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.path.text | Multi-field of `file.path`. | match_only_text |
| file.size | File size in bytes. Only relevant when `file.type` is "file". | long |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.application | When a specific application or service is identified from network connection details (source/dest IPs, ports, certificates, or wire format), this field captures the application's or service's name. For example, the original event identifies the network connection being from a specific web service in a `https` network connection, like `facebook` or `twitter`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |
| network.name | Name given by operators to sections of their network. | keyword |
| network.packets | Total packets transferred in both directions. If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets` is their sum. | long |
| network.protocol | In the OSI Model this would be the Application Layer protocol. For example, `http`, `dns`, or `ssh`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.vlan.id | VLAN ID as reported by the observer. | keyword |
| observer.egress.interface.name | Interface name as reported by the system. | keyword |
| observer.hostname | Hostname of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.ingress.interface.name | Interface name as reported by the system. | keyword |
| observer.mac | MAC addresses of the observer. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| observer.product | The product name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.type | The type of the observer the data is coming from. There is no predefined list of observer types. Some examples are `forwarder`, `firewall`, `ids`, `ips`, `proxy`, `poller`, `sensor`, `APM server`. | keyword |
| observer.vendor | Vendor name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.version | Observer version. | keyword |
| process.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.name.text | Multi-field of `process.name`. | match_only_text |
| process.parent.name | Process name. Sometimes called program name or similar. | keyword |
| process.parent.name.text | Multi-field of `process.parent.name`. | match_only_text |
| process.parent.pid | Process id. | long |
| process.parent.title | Process title. The proctitle, some times the same as process name. Can also be different: for example a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened. | keyword |
| process.parent.title.text | Multi-field of `process.parent.title`. | match_only_text |
| process.pid | Process id. | long |
| process.title | Process title. The proctitle, some times the same as process name. Can also be different: for example a browser setting its title to the web page currently opened. | keyword |
| process.title.text | Multi-field of `process.title`. | match_only_text |
| related.hosts | All hostnames or other host identifiers seen on your event. Example identifiers include FQDNs, domain names, workstation names, or aliases. | keyword |
| related.ip | All of the IPs seen on your event. | ip |
| related.user | All the user names or other user identifiers seen on the event. | keyword |
| rule.name | The name of the rule or signature generating the event. | keyword |
| server.domain | The domain name of the server system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |
| server.ip | IP address of the server (IPv4 or IPv6). | ip |
| server.mac | MAC address of the server. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| server.registered_domain | The highest registered server domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| server.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| server.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `source.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| source.bytes | Bytes sent from the source to the destination. | long |
| source.domain | The domain name of the source system. This value may be a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or another host naming format. The value may derive from the original event or be added from enrichment. | keyword |

| source.mac | MAC address of the source. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| source.nat.ip | Translated ip of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | ip |
| source.nat.port | Translated port of source based NAT sessions. (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | long |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| source.registered_domain | The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| source.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| source.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| tags | List of keywords used to tag each event. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.description | Describes the type of action conducted by the threat. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.file.hash.sha256 | SHA256 hash. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| threat.indicator.last_seen | The date and time when intelligence source last reported sighting this indicator. | date |
| threat.indicator.reference | Reference URL linking to additional information about this indicator. | keyword |
| threat.software.type | The type of software used by this threat to conduct behavior commonly modeled using MITRE ATT&CK®. Recommended values   \* Malware   \* Tool   While not required, you can use a MITRE ATT&CK® software type. | keyword |
| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| url.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| user.domain | Name of the directory the user is a member of. For example, an LDAP or Active Directory domain name. | keyword |
| user.full_name | User's full name, if available. | keyword |
| user.full_name.text | Multi-field of `user.full_name`. | match_only_text |
| user.id | Unique identifier of the user. | keyword |
| user.name | Short name or login of the user. | keyword |
| user.name.text | Multi-field of `user.name`. | match_only_text |
| user_agent.original | Unparsed user_agent string. | keyword |

Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.answers.name | The domain name to which this resource record pertains. If a chain of CNAME is being resolved, each answer's `name` should be the one that corresponds with the answer's `data`. It should not simply be the original `question.name` repeated. | keyword |
| dns.answers.type | The type of data contained in this resource record. | keyword |
| dns.question.registered_domain | The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |

For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| dns.question.type | The type of record being queried. | keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.action | The action captured by the event. This describes the information in the event. It is more specific than `event.category`. Examples are `group-add`, `process-started`, `file-created`. The value is normally defined by the implementer. | keyword |
| event.category | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the second level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.category` represents the "big buckets" of ECS categories. For example, filtering on `event.category:process` yields all events relating to process activity. This field is closely related to `event.type`, which is used as a subcategory. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple categories. | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event, if one exists. Some event sources use event codes to identify messages unambiguously, regardless of message language or wording adjustments over time. An example of this is the Windows Event ID. | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.original | Raw text message of entire event. Used to demonstrate log integrity or where the full log message (before splitting it up in multiple parts) may be required, e.g. for reindex. This field is not indexed and doc_values are disabled. It cannot be searched, but it can be retrieved from `_source`. If users wish to override this and index this field, please see `Field data types` in the `Elasticsearch Reference`. | keyword |
| event.outcome | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the lowest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.outcome` simply denotes whether the event represents a success or a failure from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. Note that when a single transaction is described in multiple events, each event may populate different values of `event.outcome`, according to their perspective. Also note that in the case of a compound event (a single event that contains multiple logical events), this field should be populated with the value that best captures the overall success or failure from the perspective of the event producer. Further note that not all events will have an associated outcome. For example, this field is generally not populated for metric events, events with `event.type:info`, or any events for which an outcome does not make logical sense. | keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the third level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.type` represents a categorization "sub-bucket" that, when used along with the `event.category` field values, enables filtering events down to a level appropriate for single visualization. This field is an array. This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types. | keyword |
| file.attributes | Array of file attributes. Attributes names will vary by platform. Here's a non-exhaustive list of values that are expected in this field: archive, compressed, directory, encrypted, execute, hidden, read, readonly, system, write. | keyword |
| file.directory | Directory where the file is located. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.extension | File extension, excluding the leading dot. Note that when the file name has multiple extensions (example.tar.gz), only the last one should be captured ("gz", not "tar.gz"). | keyword |
| file.name | Name of the file including the extension, without the directory. | keyword |
| file.path | Full path to the file, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. | keyword |
| file.path.text | Multi-field of `file.path`. | match_only_text |
| file.size | File size in bytes. Only relevant when `file.type` is "file". | long |
| file.type | File type (file, dir, or symlink). | keyword |
| geo.city_name | City name. | keyword |
| geo.country_name | Country name. | keyword |
| geo.name | User-defined description of a location, at the level of granularity they care about. Could be the name of their data centers, the floor number, if this describes a local physical entity, city names. Not typically used in automated geolocation. | keyword |
| geo.region_name | Region name. | keyword |
| group.id | Unique identifier for the group on the system/platform. | keyword |
| group.name | Name of the group. | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host MAC addresses. The notation format from RFC 7042 is suggested: Each octet (that is, 8-bit byte) is represented by two [uppercase] hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer. Successive octets are separated by a hyphen. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| http.request.method | HTTP request method. The value should retain its casing from the original event. For example, `GET`, `get`, and `GeT` are all considered valid values for this field. | keyword |
| http.request.referrer | Referrer for this HTTP request. | keyword |
| input.type | Type of Filebeat input. | keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. It should include the drive letter, when appropriate. If the event wasn't read from a log file, do not populate this field. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| log.offset | Offset of the entry in the log file. | long |
| log.source.address | Source address from which the log event was read / sent from. | keyword |
| log.syslog.facility.code | The Syslog numeric facility of the log event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, this value should be an integer between 0 and 23. | long |
| log.syslog.priority | Syslog numeric priority of the event, if available. According to RFCs 5424 and 3164, the priority is 8 \* facility + severity. This number is therefore expected to contain a value between 0 and 191. | long |
| log.syslog.severity.code | The Syslog numeric severity of the log event, if available. If the event source publishing via Syslog provides a different numeric severity value (e.g. firewall, IDS), your source's numeric severity should go to `event.severity`. If the event source does not specify a distinct severity, you can optionally copy the Syslog severity to `event.severity`. | long |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| network.application | When a specific application or service is identified from network connection details (source/dest IPs, ports, certificates, or wire format), this field captures the application's or service's name. For example, the original event identifies the network connection being from a specific web service in a `https` network connection, like `facebook` or `twitter`. The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. | keyword |
| network.bytes | Total bytes transferred in both directions. If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is their sum. | long |
| network.direction | Direction of the network traffic. Recommended values are:   \* ingress   \* egress   \* inbound   \* outbound   \* internal   \* external   \* unknown  When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress". When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context, populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter, using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external". Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful for ISPs or VPN service providers. | keyword |
| network.forwarded_ip | Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy. | ip |

| observer.name | Custom name of the observer. This is a name that can be given to an observer. This can be helpful for example if multiple firewalls of the same model are used in an organization. If no custom name is needed, the field can be left empty. | keyword |
| observer.product | The product name of the observer. | keyword |
| observer.serial_number | Observer serial number. | keyword |
| observer.type | The type of the observer the data is coming from. There is no predefined list of observer types. Some examples are `forwarder`, `firewall`, `ids`, `ips`, `proxy`, `poller`, `sensor`, `APM server`. | keyword |

| server.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| server.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| service.name | Name of the service data is collected from. The name of the service is normally user given. This allows for distributed services that run on multiple hosts to correlate the related instances based on the name. In the case of Elasticsearch the `service.name` could contain the cluster name. For Beats the `service.name` is by default a copy of the `service.type` field if no name is specified. | keyword |
| source.address | Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field. Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is. | keyword |
| source.as.number | Unique number allocated to the autonomous system. The autonomous system number (ASN) uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. | long |
| source.as.organization.name | Organization name. | keyword |
| source.as.organization.name.text | Multi-field of `source.as.organization.name`. | match_only_text |
| source.bytes | Bytes sent from the source to the destination. | long |

| source.nat.ip | Translated ip of source based NAT sessions (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically connections traversing load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | ip |
| source.nat.port | Translated port of source based NAT sessions. (e.g. internal client to internet) Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers. | long |
| source.port | Port of the source. | long |
| source.registered_domain | The highest registered source domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk". | keyword |
| source.subdomain | The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of the names below the registered domain. For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk" is "east". If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com", the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period. | keyword |
| source.top_level_domain | The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix, is the last part of the domain name. For example, the top level domain for example.com is "com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org).

| url.domain | Domain of the url, such as "www.elastic.co". In some cases a URL may refer to an IP and/or port directly, without a domain name. In this case, the IP address would go to the `domain` field. If the URL contains a literal IPv6 address enclosed by `[` and `]` (IETF RFC 2732), the `[` and `]` characters should also be captured in the `domain` field. | keyword |
| url.original | Unmodified original url as seen in the event source. Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path. This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not. | wildcard |
| url.original.text | Multi-field of `url.original`. | match_only_text |
| url.path | Path of the request, such as "/search". | wildcard |
| url.query | The query field describes the query string of the request, such as "q=elasticsearch". The `?` is excluded from the query string. If a URL contains no `?`, there is no query field. If there is a `?` but no query, the query field exists with an empty string. The `exists` query can be used to differentiate between the two cases. | keyword |
| url.registered_domain | The highest registered url domain, stripped of the subdomain. For example, the registered domain for "foo.example.com" is "example.com". This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org).
