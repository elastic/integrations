# Azure Application State Integration

The Application State Integration allows users to retrieve application insights state related metrics from specified applications.

### Integration level configuration options

`Application ID`:: (_[]string_) ID of the application. This is Application ID from the API Access settings blade in the Azure portal.

`Api Key`:: (_[]string_) The API key which will be generated, more on the steps here https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID.


## Additional notes about metrics and costs

Costs: Metric queries are charged based on the number of standard API calls. More information on pricing here https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/.

| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| host | A host is defined as a general computing instance. ECS host.\* fields should be populated with details about the host on which the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken. Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes. | group |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
