      description: 'ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events.

        When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events.'
      example: 1.0.0

    These fields can represent errors of any kind.
    Use them for errors that happen while fetching events or in cases where the
    event itself contains an error.

  description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log or metric event itself.

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened. Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional details about metric and state events.'

      description: 'Name of the dataset.

        If an event source publishes more than one type of log or events (e.g. access log, error log), the dataset is used to specify which one the event comes from.

        It''s recommended but not required to start the dataset name with the module name, followed by a dot, then the dataset name.'

      description: 'Duration of the event in nanoseconds.

        If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time.'

      description: 'Name of the module this data is coming from.

        If your monitoring agent supports the concept of modules or plugins to process events of a given source (e.g. Apache logs), `event.module` should contain the name of this module.'
