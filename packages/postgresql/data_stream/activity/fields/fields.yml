        Current overall state of this backend. Possible values are:

          * active: The backend is executing a query.
          * idle: The backend is waiting for a new client command.
          * idle in transaction: The backend is in a transaction, but is not
            currently executing a query.
          * idle in transaction (aborted): This state is similar to idle in
            transaction, except one of the statements in the transaction caused
            an error.
          * fastpath function call: The backend is executing a fast-path function.
          * disabled: This state is reported if track_activities is disabled in this backend.
    - name: query
      type: keyword
      dimension: true
      # Reason to add as a dimension field: pg_stat_bgwriter and pg_stat_database returns same fields. The length of the query is very small and hence content hashing is not needed.
      description: |
        Text of this backend's most recent query. If state is active this field shows the currently executing query. In all other states, it shows the last query that was executed.
