# PostgreSQL Integration

This integration periodically fetches logs and metrics from [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) servers.

## Compatibility

The `log` dataset was tested with logs from versions 9.5 on Ubuntu, 9.6 on Debian, and finally 10.11, 11.4 and 12.2 on Arch Linux 9.3. CSV format was tested using versions 11 and 13 (distro is not relevant here).

The `activity`, `bgwriter`, `database` and `statement` datasets were tested with PostgreSQL 9.5.3 and is expected to work with all versions `>= 9`.

## Logs

### log

The `log` dataset collects the PostgreSQL logs in plain text format or CSV.

#### Using CSV logs

Since the PostgreSQL CSV log file is a well-defined format,
there is almost no configuration to be done in Fleet, just the filepath.

On the other hand, it's necessary to configure PostgreSQL to emit `.csv` logs.

The recommended parameters are:
```
logging_collector = 'on';
log_destination = 'csvlog';
log_statement = 'none';
log_checkpoints = on;
log_connections = on;
log_disconnections = on;
log_lock_waits = on;
log_min_duration_statement = 0;
```

In busy servers, `log_min_duration_statement` can cause contention, so you can assign
a value greater than 0.

Both `log_connections` and `log_disconnections` can cause a lot of events if you don't have
persistent connections, so enable with care.

**Exported fields**

| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Event timestamp. | date |
| cloud.account.id | The cloud account or organization id used to identify different entities in a multi-tenant environment. Examples: AWS account id, Google Cloud ORG Id, or other unique identifier. | keyword |
| cloud.availability_zone | Availability zone in which this host is running. | keyword |
| cloud.image.id | Image ID for the cloud instance. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.id | Instance ID of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.instance.name | Instance name of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.machine.type | Machine type of the host machine. | keyword |
| cloud.project.id | Name of the project in Google Cloud. | keyword |
| cloud.provider | Name of the cloud provider. Example values are aws, azure, gcp, or digitalocean. | keyword |
| cloud.region | Region in which this host is running. | keyword |
| container.id | Unique container id. | keyword |
| container.image.name | Name of the image the container was built on. | keyword |
| container.labels | Image labels. | object |
| container.name | Container name. | keyword |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | Data stream namespace. | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type. | constant_keyword |
| ecs.version | ECS version this event conforms to. `ecs.version` is a required field and must exist in all events. When querying across multiple indices -- which may conform to slightly different ECS versions -- this field lets integrations adjust to the schema version of the events. | keyword |
| error.code | Error code describing the error. | keyword |
| error.id | Unique identifier for the error. | keyword |
| error.message | Error message. | match_only_text |
| event.category | Event category (e.g. database) | keyword |
| event.code | Identification code for this event | keyword |
| event.dataset | Event dataset | constant_keyword |
| event.duration | Duration of the event in nanoseconds. If event.start and event.end are known this value should be the difference between the end and start time. | long |
| event.ingested | Timestamp when an event arrived in the central data store. This is different from `@timestamp`, which is when the event originally occurred.  It's also different from `event.created`, which is meant to capture the first time an agent saw the event. In normal conditions, assuming no tampering, the timestamps should chronologically look like this: `@timestamp` \< `event.created` \< `event.ingested`. | date |
| event.kind | This is one of four ECS Categorization Fields, and indicates the highest level in the ECS category hierarchy. `event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event. For example, values of this field distinguish alert events from metric events. The value of this field can be used to inform how these kinds of events should be handled. They may warrant different retention, different access control, it may also help understand whether the data coming in at a regular interval or not. | keyword |
| event.module | Event module | constant_keyword |
| event.timezone | This field should be populated when the event's timestamp does not include timezone information already (e.g. default Syslog timestamps). It's optional otherwise. Acceptable timezone formats are: a canonical ID (e.g. "Europe/Amsterdam"), abbreviated (e.g. "EST") or an HH:mm differential (e.g. "-05:00"). | keyword |
| event.type | Event severity (e.g. info, error) | keyword |
| host.architecture | Operating system architecture. | keyword |
| host.containerized | If the host is a container. | boolean |
| host.domain | Name of the domain of which the host is a member. For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name. For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider. | keyword |
| host.hostname | Hostname of the host. It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine. | keyword |
| host.id | Unique host id. As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful in your environment. Example: The current usage of `beat.name`. | keyword |
| host.ip | Host ip addresses. | ip |
| host.mac | Host mac addresses. | keyword |
| host.name | Name of the host. It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender decides which value to use. | keyword |
| host.os.build | OS build information. | keyword |
| host.os.codename | OS codename, if any. | keyword |
| host.os.family | OS family (such as redhat, debian, freebsd, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.kernel | Operating system kernel version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.os.name | Operating system name, without the version. | keyword |
| host.os.name.text | Multi-field of `host.os.name`. | text |
| host.os.platform | Operating system platform (such centos, ubuntu, windows). | keyword |
| host.os.version | Operating system version as a raw string. | keyword |
| host.type | Type of host. For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`. If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information meaningful in your environment. | keyword |
| log.level | Original log level of the log event. If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity). Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`. | keyword |
| message | For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized for viewing in a log viewer. For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated to form a human-readable summary of the event. If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message. | match_only_text |
| postgresql.log.application_name | Name of the application of this event. It is defined by the client. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.backend_type | Type of backend of this event. Possible types are autovacuum launcher, autovacuum worker, logical replication launcher, logical replication worker, parallel worker, background writer, client backend, checkpointer, startup, walreceiver, walsender and walwriter. In addition, background workers registered by extensions may have additional types. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.client_addr | Host where the connection originated from. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.client_port | Port where the connection originated from. | long |
| postgresql.log.command_tag | Type of session's current command. The complete list can be found at: src/include/tcop/cmdtaglist.h | keyword |

| postgresql.log.hint | A possible solution to solve an error. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.internal_query | Internal query that led to the error (if any). | keyword |
| postgresql.log.internal_query_pos | Character count of the internal query (if any). | long |
| postgresql.log.location | Location of the error in the PostgreSQL source code (if log_error_verbosity is set to verbose). | keyword |
| postgresql.log.query | Query statement. In the case of CSV parse, look at command_tag to get more context. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.query_name | Name given to a query when using extended query protocol. If it is `"\<unnamed\>"`, or not present, this field is ignored. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.query_pos | Character count of the error position (if any). | long |
| postgresql.log.query_step | Statement step when using extended query protocol (one of statement, parse, bind or execute). | keyword |
| postgresql.log.session_id | PostgreSQL session. | keyword |
| postgresql.log.session_line_number | Line number inside a session. (%l in `log_line_prefix`). | long |
| postgresql.log.session_start_time | Time when this session started. | date |
