# Kafka integration

This integration collects logs and metrics from [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) servers.

## Compatibility

The `log` dataset is tested with logs from Kafka 0.9, 1.1.0 and 2.0.0.

The `broker`, `consumergroup`, `partition` datastreams are tested with Kafka 0.10.2.1, 1.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.2.2 and 3.6.0.

The `broker` metricset requires Jolokia to fetch JMX metrics. Refer to the Metricbeat documentation about Jolokia for more information.

## Logs

### log

The `log` dataset collects and parses logs from Kafka servers.

### raft

The `raft` dataset collects metrics related to Kafka's Raft consensus algorithm implementation (KRaft), which is used for metadata management in Kafka without requiring ZooKeeper. KRaft mode is available in Kafka 3.0.0 and later versions.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Append and fetch records rates
- Commit latency (average and maximum)
- Current epoch, leader, and vote information
- High watermark and log offset metrics
- Node state and voter information
- Poll idle ratio

### controller

The `controller` dataset collects metrics related to the Kafka controller, which is responsible for managing broker states, partition assignments, and other administrative operations in the Kafka cluster.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Controller event manager metrics (queue processing and wait times)
- Cluster state metrics (active brokers, controllers, topics, and partitions)
- Record management metrics (lag, offset, and timestamp information)
- Error and health metrics (offline partitions, heartbeat timeouts, metadata errors)

### replica_manager

The `replica_manager` dataset collects metrics related to Kafka's replica management system, which is responsible for handling data replication across brokers in the Kafka cluster.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- ReplicaAlterLogDirsManager metrics (dead threads, failed partitions, lag, and fetch rates)
- ReplicaFetcherManager metrics (dead threads, failed partitions, lag, and fetch rates)
- In-Sync Replica (ISR) metrics (expansions, shrinks, and update failures)
- Partition metrics (leader count, offline replicas, under-replicated partitions)
- Reassignment and replication health metrics (reassigning partitions, under min ISR partition count)

### jvm

The `jvm` dataset collects metrics related to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running the Kafka broker, providing insights into the performance and health of the Java runtime environment.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Runtime metrics (uptime, VM name, version, and vendor)
- Memory metrics (heap and non-heap usage, memory pool statistics)
- Threading metrics (thread counts, deadlocks, thread states)
- Garbage collection metrics (collection counts and times)
- Class loading metrics (loaded and unloaded class counts)
- Buffer pool metrics (memory usage and capacity)
- JIT compilation metrics (time spent in compilation)

### log_manager

The `log_manager` dataset collects metrics related to Kafka's log management system, which is responsible for handling log segments, cleaning, and maintenance operations.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Log cleaner metrics (buffer utilization, cleaning times, recopy percentages)
- Cleaner manager metrics (dirty log percentages, uncleanable partitions)
- Log directory metrics (offline directories, directory status)
- Log flush statistics (flush rates and times)
- Log recovery metrics (remaining logs and segments to recover)

### network

The `network` dataset collects metrics related to Kafka's network subsystem, providing insights into the broker's network performance, request handling, and socket server operations.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Socket server metrics (memory pool usage, expired connections)
- Network processor metrics (idle percentages, queue sizes)
- Request metrics for different request types (processing times, queue times)
- Throttle time metrics (how long requests are throttled)
- Request and response size metrics
- Request channel metrics (queue sizes and processing performance)

{{event "network"}}

### topic

The `topic` dataset collects metrics specific to Kafka topics and their partitions, providing insights into topic throughput, partition health, and log segment information.

This dataset includes metrics such as:
- Topic-level metrics (bytes in/out per second, message rates, fetch request rates)
- Partition metrics (in-sync replicas, under-replicated status, minimum ISR status)
- Log metrics (offset information, segment counts, log sizes)
