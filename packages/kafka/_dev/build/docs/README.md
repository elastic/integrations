# Kafka integration

This integration collects logs and metrics from [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) servers.

## Compatibility

The `log` dataset is tested with logs from Kafka 0.9, 1.1.0 and 2.0.0.

The `broker`, `consumergroup`, `partition` and `producer` metricsets are tested with Kafka 0.10.2.1, 1.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.2.2.

The `broker` metricset requires Jolokia to fetch JMX metrics. Refer to the Metricbeat documentation about Jolokia for more information.

## Logs
