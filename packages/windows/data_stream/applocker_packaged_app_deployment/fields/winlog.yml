    - name: api

      description: >
        The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the Event Logging API.

        The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically detects which API to use for reading event logs.

    - name: activity_id
      type: keyword
      description: >
        A globally unique identifier that identifies the current activity. The events that are published with this identifier are part of the same activity.

    - name: computer_name
      type: keyword
      description: >
        The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows event forwarding, this name can differ from `agent.hostname`.

      description: >
        The event-specific data. This field is mutually exclusive with `user_data`. If you are capturing event data on versions prior to Windows Vista, the parameters in `event_data` are named `param1`, `param2`, and so on, because event log parameters are unnamed in earlier versions of Windows.

        This is a non-exhaustive list of parameters that are used in Windows events. By having these fields defined in the template they can be used in dashboards and machine-learning jobs.
