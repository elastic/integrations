# Elastic Integrations

This repository contains sources for Elastic Integrations. Each Elastic Integration is an Elastic Package that defines how to observe a specific product with the Elastic Stack.

An Elastic Package may define configuration for the [Elastic Agent](#elastic-agent) as well as assets (such as Kibana dashboards and Elasticsearch index templates) for the Elastic Stack. It should also define documentation about the package. Finally, a package may also define tests to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

Elastic Packages have a certain, well-defined structure. This structure is described by the [Package Specification](#package-specification). The repository is also used for discussions about extending the specification (with proposals).

While this repository contains _sources_ for Elastic Integrations, _built_ Elastic Integrations are published into a storage based on Google Cloud bucket (more info [here](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-package/blob/85d6fcacad736e543e459a044a5e0fa48b5d43c6/docs/howto/use_package_storage_v2.md)) and served up via the [Package Registry](#package-registry). The Fleet UI in Kibana connects to the Package Registry and allows users to discover, install, and configure Elastic Packages.
