# Vale Report Workflow
#
# This workflow posts Vale linting results as PR comments.
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow requires lint.yml to run first.
# The workflow name in the 'workflows' array below must match exactly.
#
# Why two workflows?
# GitHub restricts fork PRs from having write access to the base repo.
# Using workflow_run trigger allows posting comments even on fork PRs
# because this workflow runs in the context of the base repository.
