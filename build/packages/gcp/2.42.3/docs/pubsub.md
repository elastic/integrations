# PubSub

## Metrics

The `pubsub` dataset fetches metrics from [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP PubSub Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-pubsub).

You can specify a single region to fetch metrics like `us-central1`. Be aware that GCP PubSub does not use zones so `us-central1-a` will return nothing. If no region is specified, it will return metrics from all buckets.

## Sample Event
    
An example event for `pubsub` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {
            "id": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev",
            "name": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev"
        },
        "instance": {
            "id": "4751091017865185079",
            "name": "gke-cluster-1-default-pool-6617a8aa-5clh"
        },

            "subscription": {
                "backlog": {

                }
            }
        },
        "labels": {
            "user": {
                "goog-gke-node": ""
            }
        }
    },
    "host": {
        "id": "4751091017865185079",
        "name": "gke-cluster-1-default-pool-6617a8aa-5clh"
    },
    "metricset": {

    }
}
```
