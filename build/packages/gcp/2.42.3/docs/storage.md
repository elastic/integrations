# Storage

## Metrics

The `storage` dataset fetches metrics from [Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) in Google Cloud Platform. It contains all metrics exported from the [GCP Storage Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-storage).

You can specify a single region to fetch metrics like `us-central1`. Be aware that GCP Storage does not use zones so `us-central1-a` will return nothing. If no region is specified, it will return metrics from all buckets.

## Sample Event
    
An example event for `storage` looks as following:

```json
{
    "@timestamp": "2017-10-12T08:05:34.853Z",
    "cloud": {
        "account": {
            "id": "elastic-obs-integrations-dev",

        },
        "instance": {

            "name": "gke-cluster-1-default-pool-6617a8aa-5clh"
        },

        },

                    "bytes": 4472520191
                }
            }
        },
        "labels": {
            "user": {
                "goog-gke-node": ""
            }
        }
    },
    "host": {
        "id": "4751091017865185079",
        "name": "gke-cluster-1-default-pool-6617a8aa-5clh"
    },
    "metricset": {
        "name": "storage",
        "period": 10000
    },
    "service": {
        "type": "gcp"
    }
}
```
