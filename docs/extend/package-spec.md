# Package specification [package-spec]

Integrations are a type of package and therefore must adhere to the Elastic package specification. The package specification describes:

* The folder structure of a package and the expected files within these folders
* The structure of expected files' contents


### Asset organization [asset-organization]

In general, assets within a package are organized by `<elastic-stack-component>/<asset-type>`. For example, ingest pipelines are stored in the `elasticsearch/ingest-pipeline` folder. This logic applies to all {{es}}, {{kib}}, and Agent assets.

Top-level assets are picked up as JSON documents and pushed to the corresponding {{es}} and {{kib}} APIs.


#### Data streams [data-streams]

There is a specific folder called `data_stream`. Each data stream should have its folder of assets within this folder, and the names of these data streams must follow the data stream naming scheme.

The contents of these folders follow the `<elastic-stack-component>/<asset-type>` structure. During installation, {{fleet}} enforces data stream naming rules. All assets in this folder belong directly or indirectly to data streams.

In most scenarios, only data stream assets are needed. However, there are exceptions where global assets are required to get more flexibility. For example, an {{ilm-init}} policy that applies to all data streams.


### Supported assets [supported-assets]

The following assets are typically found in an Elastic package:

* {es}

    * Ingest Pipeline
    * Index Template
    * Transform
    * Index template settings

* {kib}

    * Dashboards
    * Visualization
    * {data-sources-cap}
    * {{ml-init}} Modules
    * Map
    * Search
    * Security rules

* Other

    * fields.yml



### Directory structure [directory-structure]

```text
apache
│   changelog.yml
│   manifest.yml
└───_dev
└───data_stream
└───docs
└───img
└───kibana
```
