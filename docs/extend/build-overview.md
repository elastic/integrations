# Overview and prerequisites [build-overview]

Before building an integration, you should have an understanding of the following:

* {{stack}} concepts, like data streams, ingest pipelines, and mappings
* The [*Package specification*](/extend/package-spec.md)

In addition, you must have [`elastic-package`](/extend/elastic-package.md) installed on your machine. Using `elastic-package` is recommended for integration maintainers as it provides crucial utilities and scripts for building out integrations.
