# Build an integration [build-a-new-integration]

Ready to monitor, ingest, and visualize something? Let’s get started. You’ll build an integration package that defines how data is collected, processed, and presented.

* [Overview and prerequisites](/extend/build-overview.md): Get familiar with Elastic Stack fundamentals, including data streams, ingest pipelines, and field mappings, and review what you need before starting.
* [Spin up the {{stack}}](/extend/build-spin-stack.md): Set up and launch your local {{stack}} environment for development and testing.
* [Create a new package](/extend/build-create-package.md): Scaffold a new integration package using the elastic-package CLI, establishing the required directory structure and manifest files.
* [Add a data stream](/extend/add-data-stream.md): Define a new data stream to specify how your integration will collect and organize time-series data.
* [Define deployment modes](/extend/define-deployment-modes.md): Configure how your integration can be deployed, such as agent-based or agentless modes.
* [Edit ingest pipelines](/extend/edit-ingest-pipeline.md): Customize ingest pipelines to parse, enrich, and transform incoming data before it’s indexed.
* [Edit field mappings](/extend/add-mapping.md): Specify and adjust field mappings to define the structure and types of your indexed data.
* [Create and export dashboards](/extend/create-dashboards.md): Build {{kib}} dashboards and visualizations to explore and analyze the ingested data.
* [Testing and validation](/extend/testing-validation.md): Run tests and validate your integration to ensure it works as expected and meets quality standards.
* [Finishing touches](/extend/finishing-touches.md): Finalize documentation, metadata, and package details to prepare your integration for release.
* [Tips for building integrations](/extend/tips-for-building.md): Explore best practices and helpful advice to streamline your integration development process.
