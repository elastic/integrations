# CI integrations pipelines

This section describes the CI pipelines available in this repository.

Currently, there are five different pipelines:
- https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations: pipeline in charge of testing all packages using a local Elastic stack. More info at [section](#pull-requests-and-pushes-to-specific-branches).
- https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-serverless: pipeline in charge of testing all packages using a Elastic Serverless project. More info at [section](#serverless-pipeline).
- https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-publish: pipeline to publish the new versions of packages. More info at [section](#publish-packages).
- https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-schedule-daily/: pipeline running every night to test packages in different scenarios. More info at [section](#daily-job).
- https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-backport/: pipeline to create backport branches (just from UI). More info at [section](#backport-branches-pipeline).

## Pull Requests and pushes to specific branches

In every push to a Pull Request as well as commits to `main` or `backport-*` branches, this pipeline is triggered automatically: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations

This pipeline is in charge of testing the packages with a local Elastic stack.

Special comments that can be added in the Pull Request (by Elastic employees):
- `/test` or `buildkite test this`: a new build is triggered.
- `/test benchmark fullreport`: a new build is triggered creating a full benchmark report (it will be posted as a GitHub comment in the PR).

There are some environment variables that can be added into this pipeline:
- **FORCE_CHECK_ALL**: If `true`, this forces the CI to check all packages even if those packages have no file updated/added/deleted. Default: `false`.
- **STACK_VERSION**: Force the CI steps to spin up a specific Elastic stack version to run the tests. Default: unset.
- **PUBLISH_COVERAGE_REPORTS**: If `true`, it enables reporting coverage reports.
Currently, it is just set for the build triggered with the current major Elastic stack from the daily job. Default: `false`.

These environment variables can be defined in different locations:
- In the [global `env` section](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/5276ef63712f8f2311818770881688870e8422fe/.buildkite/pipeline.yml#L2).
- In the case of the scheduled daily job here:
    - [Running tests with previous major Elastic stack](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/5276ef63712f8f2311818770881688870e8422fe/.buildkite/pipeline.schedule-daily.yml#L21).
    - [Running tests with current major Elastic stack](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.schedule-daily.yml#L32).

More details about this CI pipeline:

- Builds running in a Pull Request are canceled if a new commit is pushed to the PR branch.
- Builds running from `main` or `backport-*` branches are finished even if new commits are merged.
- As part of the Pull Requests, there are some benchmark files created and this data is pushed to the PR as a comment.
- This CI pipeline tries to test the minimum packages possible::
    - In the Pull Request context, it is checked the files modified/added/deleted in the given PR:
        - Those packages with changes (`packages/*`) will be added to the list of packages to be tested.
        - If files outside `packages` folder are updated (e.g. `go.mod` , `.buildkite/*`), all packages are going to be tested. There are some exceptions to this, for instance the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file or `.docs/` folder ([files excluded](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/376fc891a1e6c662b4ef1897b118044faf51e7bf/.buildkite/scripts/common.sh#L695)).
    - In branches context (`main` or `backport-*`):
        - The latest Buildkite build that finished successfully in that branch is retrieved, and all the file changes in the working copy between the changeset of that build and the merged commit are obtained.
        - Given all those changes, the packages selected to be tested follow the same rules as in the PR.
- Container logs, as they could contain sensitive information, are uploaded to a private Google Bucket.
- Packages are tested running the Elastic stack with the minimum Kibana version supported according to their manifest (`.conditions.kibana.version`). If a package defines a Kibana version that is not released yet, `elastic-package` will be using the SNAPSHOT version. This can be overridden if the STACK_VERSION variable is defined in the environment.
  In the following table, there are some examples:
    
  | STACK_VERSION env | Kibana Condition Package | Released | Elastic stack run |
  | :---:    | :---:                | :---: | :---:             |
  | ""       | `^7.16.0 || ^8.0.0`  | Yes   | `7.16.0`          |
  | ""       | `^8.12.0`            | Yes   | `8.12.0`          |
  | ""       | `^8.14.1`            | Yes   | `8.14.1`          |
  | ""       | `^8.15.0`            | No    | `8.15.0-SNAPSHOT` |
  | `8.14.0` | `^8.13.0`            | Yes   | `8.14.0`          |

  If the STACK_VERSION environment variable is defined, just the packages supporting that stack version are tested. For instance:

  | STACK_VERSION env | Kibana Condition Package | Tested |
  | :---:  | :---: | :---: | 
  | `7.17.0` | `^7.16.0 \|\| ^8.0.0` | Yes |
  | `7.17.0` | `^8.12.0`             | No  |
  | `8.12.0` | `^8.13.0`             | No  |
  | `8.14.0` | `^8.13.0`             | Yes |


## Publish packages

**Note**: Just available for Employees at Elastic.

For every Pull Request merged onto the `main` branch or any `backport-*` branches,
this pipeline is triggered automatically https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-publish to publish new versions
of the packages if any. These new versions are published and made available in https://epr.elastic.co

Environment variables that can be defined in this pipeline:
- **DRY_RUN**: If `true`, packages will not be published. Default: `false`.
- **SKIP_PUBLISHING**: If `true`, not run at all publish procedures. Default: `false`.

These environment variables can be defined:
- At the [global `env` section](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.publish.yml#L3).
- At the [specific buildkite publish step](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.publish.yml#L37).
- In case of the [step from schedule-daily job](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.schedule-daily.yml#L61)
  (it needs to be added the `env` dictionary).

## Serverless Pipeline

**Note**: Just available for Employees at Elastic.

Pipeline in charge of testing all packages with an Elastic Serverless project (https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-serverless). 

This pipeline follows these steps:
1. Create an Elastic Serverless project of a given type. Currently supported: Observability or Security
1. For each package in the repository:
    1. Check if the package is supported in the given Elastic Serverless project.
        1. Packages can define which capabilities they need. Depending on those, the package could be available or not in the Serverless project, and therefore they will be tested or not.
            - [Capabilities defined for Observability projects](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/40a2bdf651b0eabe5977367ad1b875e7581f0e31/config/serverless.oblt.yml#L145).
            - [Capabilities defined for Security capabilities](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/40a2bdf651b0eabe5977367ad1b875e7581f0e31/config/serverless.security.yml#L77).
        1. There are some packages that are excluded in the Kibana configuration explicitly:
            - [Packages excluded in Observability](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/7c5cf9c76e35925cba7e3bd57cc01d1fffae81a4/config/serverless.oblt.yml#L150).
            - [Packages excluded in Security](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/7c5cf9c76e35925cba7e3bd57cc01d1fffae81a4/config/serverless.security.yml#L82).
    1. Runs test for all the selected packages:
        - Currently, [system tests are not run in Serverless](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/5714f5665bbe3bc29b9e2444c6a94dbc2d5eebe9/.buildkite/scripts/common.sh#L803).
        - As in the pipeline for Pull Requests, container logs as they could contain sensitive information, they are uploaded to a private Google Bucket.
1. Deletes the Elastic Serverless project.

Environment variables that can be defined in this pipeline:
- **SERVERLESS_PROJECT**: Serverless project to be created to test packages. Default: observability.

This environment variable can be defined at:
- At the [global `env` section](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.serverless.yml#L3).
- In case of the schedule-daily job:
    - [trigger observability tests step](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.schedule-daily.yml#L46).
    - [trigger security test step](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/d6d99792b90838d18844f6df9343bc5f16130666/.buildkite/pipeline.schedule-daily.yml#L56).


## Daily job

**Note**: Just available for Employees at Elastic.

Every night it is configured to run a daily job that will be in charge of testing all packages with different scenarios: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-schedule-daily/

The schedule of this job can be checked [here](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/5714f5665bbe3bc29b9e2444c6a94dbc2d5eebe9/catalog-info.yaml#L93).

The scenarios that are tested in this daily job are:

- Test packages with a local Elastic stack running the previous major version of the stack (7.17.X SNAPSHOT).
    - Triggered pipeline: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations
- Test packages with a local Elastic stack running the latest major version of the stack (currently 8.X.Y-SNAPSHOT).
    - Triggered pipeline: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations
- Test packages with an Elastic Serverless Observability project.
    - Triggered pipeline: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integration-serverless
- Test packages with an Elastic Serverless Security project.
    - Triggered pipeline: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integration-serverless

Those tests that have failed in these scenarios will be reported as GitHub issues notifying the owner teams as defined in `.github/CODEOWNERS` file.

As part of this pipeline, it is also ensured that the latest versions of the packages merged into `main` branch
have been published by triggering the pipeline https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-publish.

Each step triggering a new pipeline can be customized through environment variables. Environment variables that can
be used in each pipeline are detailed in the corresponding sections of each pipeline.


## Backport branches pipeline

**Note**: Just available for Employees at Elastic.

Releasing hotfixes from older versions of packages requires creating `backport-*` branches from specific commits in the `main` branch.
In order to help with this task of creating these branches, there exists a pipeline that just can be triggered
from the UI: https://buildkite.com/elastic/integrations-backport/

More information about this pipeline and how to create these hotfixes in:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/integrations-developer/current/developer-workflow-support-old-package.html
