      Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always store the raw address in the `.address` field.
      Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which one it is.

      Unmodified original url as seen in the event source.
      Note that in network monitoring, the observed URL may be a full URL, whereas in access logs, the URL is often just represented as a path.
      This field is meant to represent the URL as it was observed, complete or not.
