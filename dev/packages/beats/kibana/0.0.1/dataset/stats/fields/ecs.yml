      Unique identifier of the running service. If the service is comprised of many nodes, the `service.id` should be the same for all nodes.
      This id should uniquely identify the service. This makes it possible to correlate logs and metrics for one specific service, no matter which particular node emitted the event.
      Note that if you need to see the events from one specific host of the service, you should filter on that `host.name` or `host.id` instead.
