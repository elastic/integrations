      Original log level of the log event.
      If the source of the event provides a log level or textual severity, this is the one that goes in `log.level`. If your source doesn't specify one, you may put your event transport's severity here (e.g. Syslog severity).
      Some examples are `warn`, `err`, `i`, `informational`.
