  - name: recompilations_per_sec
    type: long
    description: Number of statement recompiles per second. Counts the number of times
      statement recompiles are triggered. Generally, you want the recompiles to be
      low.
  - name: compilations_per_sec
    type: long
    description: Number of SQL compilations per second. Indicates the number of times
      the compile code path is entered. Includes compiles caused by statement-level
      recompilations in SQL Server. After SQL Server user activity is stable, this

  - name: batch_requests_per_sec
    type: long
    description: Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This
      statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cache
      size, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput.

      - name: pct
        type: double
        description: The ratio is the total number of cache hits divided by the total
          number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses. After
          a long period of time, the ratio moves very little. Because reading from
          the cache is much less expensive than reading from disk, you want this ratio
          to be high
