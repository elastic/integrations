    This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
    the event was generated by the source.

    If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
    by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

  description: "The agent fields contain the data about the software entity, if
    any, that collects, detects, or observes events on a host, or takes measurements
    on a host.

    Examples include Beats. Agents may also run on observers. ECS agent.* fields
    shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
    where the event happened or the measurement was taken."
  footnote:
    "Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
    For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does
    not change if data is sent through queuing systems like Kafka, Redis, or processing
    systems such as Logstash or APM Server."

  description: "The event fields are used for context information about the log

    A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
    Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log
    events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from
    a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server
    being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or
    more numerical or categorical measurements and the time at which the measurement
    was taken. Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host,
    or vulnerabilities measured on a scanned host."

        read by an agent, or by your pipeline.

        This field is distinct from @timestamp in that @timestamp typically contain
        the time extracted from the original event.

        In most situations, these two timestamps will be slightly different. The difference
        can be used to calculate the delay between your source generating an event,
        and the time when your agent first processed it. This can be used to monitor
        your agent's or pipeline's ability to keep up with your event source.

        In case the two timestamps are identical, @timestamp should be used."
