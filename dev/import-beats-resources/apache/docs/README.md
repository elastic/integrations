# Apache Integration

This integration periodically fetches metrics from [https://httpd.apache.org/](Apache) servers. It can parse access and error
logs created by the Apache server.

## Compatibility

The Apache datasets were tested with Apache 2.4.12 and 2.4.20 and are expected to work with
all versions >= 2.2.31 and >= 2.4.16.

## Logs

### Access Logs

Access logs collects the Apache access logs.

{{fields "access"}}

### Error Logs

Error logs collects the Apache error logs.

{{fields "error"}}

## Metrics

### Status Metrics

The server status stream collects data from the Apache Status module. It scrapes the status data from the web page
generated by the `mod_status` module.

An example event for status looks as following:

{{event "status"}}

{{fields "status"}}
