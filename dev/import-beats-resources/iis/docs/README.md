IIS (Internet Information Services) is a secure, reliable, and scalable Web server that provides an easy to manage platform for developing and hosting Web applications and services.

The `iis` package will periodically retrieve IIS related metrics using performance counters such as:

 - System/Process counters like the the overall server and CPU usage for the IIS Worker Process and memory (currently used and available memory for the IIS Worker Process).
 - IIS performance counters like Web Service: Bytes Received/Sec, Web Service: Bytes Sent/Sec, etc, which are helpful to track to identify potential spikes in traffic.
 - Web Service Cache counters in order to monitor user mode cache and output cache.

and also parses access and error logs generated by IIS.

The `iis` integration datasets are:
