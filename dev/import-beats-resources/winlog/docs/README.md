# Custom Windows event log package

The custom Windows event log package allows you to ingest events from
any Windows event log channel.  You can get a list of available event
log channels by running Get-EventLog * in PowerShell.  Custom ingest
pipelines may be added by setting one up in
[Ingest Node Pipelines](/app/management/ingest/ingest_pipelines/).
